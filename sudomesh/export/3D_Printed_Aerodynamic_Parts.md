[thumb](/File:3D_Printed_Cigar_Rocket.jpg "wikilink") For [holmaschine](/User:holmaschine "wikilink"), the advantage of 3-D printed model rocket parts is the ability to create a very thin and structurally efficient shape without concern over fabrication and the relative alignments of subparts. Components can be printed true to final form (+/-) with only light treatment required to smooth outer surfaces so long as the basic restrictions of the manufacturing method are understood.

**Nose Cones**

Several prototypes have been created in both 29mm and 65mm diameter, using a tangent-ogive profile.

TO DO: write code to generate g-code directly instead of using SolidWorks and Slic3r.

WHY: avoid 15 min + delay time using slicer, better match to theoretical shape without.

TO DO: Model payload supports integral with structural elements.

WHY: Reduce number of fasteners and/or adhesive required.

**Fin Cans**

One prototype printed, downrated to smaller engine size until proven. Will mount adapter to aft bulkhead using (4) \#4-40 screws.

Actual Rocket
=============

The picture above shows a 3D printed 2-part rocket. 65mm max diameter, 29mm motor bay, tangent ogive curve with internal 2-way structural ribs and support for airspeed sensor pitot tube at nose. Made on [our Type-A Machine](/Type_A_Machine "wikilink").
