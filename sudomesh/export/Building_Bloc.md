*At the first Omni Delegates meeting we all decided to write up a “vision” to share for this new collective. This is a draft-in-progress representing Sudoroom's vision for the collective of collectives.*

THE BUILDING BLOC
-----------------

The *Building Bloc* is a new group committing to serve our wider communities by solving the legal, logistical and economic problems related to holding physical spaces for the greater good. We are a 'meta-collective' or a 'collective of collectives'. Each of us represents a larger collective group in need of physical space. We are welcoming and encouraging new groups to join us.

### What kind of groups? Mainly:

-   Non-profit
-   Volunteer-led
-   Donation-based
-   Offer value to the public for free or sliding scale
-   So far: a school, a hackerspace, activists, artists

### What core values do groups share?

-   social, economic & environmental justice
-   solidarity with all oppressed people
-   a culture of consent, against rape, violence & exploitation
-   the survival & thrival of our communities and neighborhoods

### What do we use our physical space for?

-   To collaborate on projects
-   To host classes and performances
-   To network, meet each other, welcome newcomers
-   To store resources for common use (or equitably restricted)

### Meeting structure:

-   We try to be as democratic and transparent as possible
-   At the same time, we want to efficiently get real work done
-   Meetings are open, but please respect that we have a lot of work to do and limited time! Please don't contribute to burnout by concern-trolling, flame-baiting, or talking a whole lot about nothing! :)

### Things we haven't figured out yet:

-   How to distribute resources? When/how are groups allowed to restrict access to outsiders? Should we set a minimum baseline of public accessibility, or of offering free/sliding-scale value to the public?
-   Process for onboarding new groups: Accepting new groups could be overwhelming, or even an attack vector for people wanting to steal, subvert or derail our mission.
-   How to distribute power? One group, one vote? Participatory budgeting? IMHO we should incorporate in such a way as to make it impossible to subvert the mission - create a legal firewall that protects the core mission and even the money from everybody including ourselves. Think: land trusts
-   How to have an open, transparent process while also handling private, vulnerable, sensitive and personal information?
-   Some compromise with capitalism is probably necessary, but how much? Selling drinks? Selling fridge magnets? Selling access to a spa? How do we decide this?
-   Make sure “non-profit” can include worker-coops where people get paid for their labor, and where surplus can be reinvested in the business, without nitpicky dogmatic definitions of the word “profit”
