Wikitown/camper-deployment
==========================

Desired outcome of conversation:

-   Clarity on current state + idea
-   Potentially a time set for deployment along with actionitems.
-   Phase developments / patterns: From scouting, to camper, to tent site to
-   Pickup truck, folks to pick up campers, places to put them.
    -   Eg Adeline empty lot, Matt's street in Oakland, a few spots in SF
    -   Construction materials, furnishings, servers
-   Create instructables [for making Wikitown out of recycled materials](/Free_materials,_furnishings,_resources,_multimedia "wikilink")
-   BAHT: Bay Area Hacker Transit - network of folks to pick up materials for hackerspaces
-   Focus on Craigslist Free in Marin!
-   Also LA - Beau's friend has a warehouse, we can store in Badlands.

<!-- -->

-   Application process for potential tenants
-   Desert property for Sober Veggie House, general hacker rehab :)
-   Non-profit and trust to create sustainable model
-   Property in the desert
-   Hacker-in-Residence program - sync with Praveen and Christina

Basic idea
----------

Using campers for establishing beach head at an empty piece of land. Sort of a basecamp to work from - once you got a camper there, you can go there and hang out.

### Process

-   Go to lot and prepare road
-   Create foundation (concrete?) for camper
-   Bring it in!

### Once successfully deployed ...

-   Build a fence
-   Create a tent-structure

Campers as mini-hackerspaces
----------------------------

Patterns of hackerspaces:

-   Scout
-   Potential mothership addition in caravan + community?

What is the minimum 'stuff' required for X people to go out there and hack for 72 hours?

Currently...
------------

-   Tim has 2 campers and properties in CA.
-   We can gather free materials for everything we need to establish a wikitown, as long as we got infrastructure to get it (trucks and people) and space to store it.

### Potential Properties to Pilot on

In CA, there are several in the high desert, less than 2 hours from LA. There are 2 in Lake country, and three in North East California not far from the Oregon and Nevada border.

-   10 acres of farmland.
-   reachable by public transit
-   Gets a few feet of snow in the winter
-   Needs a well [1](http://www.youtube.com/user/dawmlw?v=XGq0ETzZP0E).
-   Has a tractor
-   2 other properties in the national forest
-   free campground nearby
-   beautiful!

Caravan/mycelia/BACH
====================

-   Starting in the Bay Area, weekly
-   Teacher Buses, Occupy Oakland bus, Anthony Di Franco, whale bus Tim mentioned
-   First weekend: hit Reno by way of Sacramento
-   Documentary/video along the way (Two Hands Project)
    -   Building awareness among non-hackers
    -   Involving people in an inter-hackerspace community
    -   Education and DIY inspiration
    -   After watching video --&gt; inspire people to help out in specific ways
    -   Video portal
    -   OpenSim telepresence
        -   Helping set up a good video space (eg as in sudo or NB)
        -   Needs to be able to fold out, be more affordable
        -   Knob for switching between hackerspaces
        -   Donated plasma screens
        -   WebRTC?
-   Workshops
    -   Intro to Electronics
    -   Intro to Hackerspaces
    -   [Hacking on hackerspaces](/Hacking_hackerspaces "wikilink") - helping to build infrastructure, set up a mesh node &lt;&lt; Mesh node\*\*: wifi via space? will the eco-village have wifi?

Property searching
==================

-   GIS files w/ parcel outlines
-   Analysis of flood plain areas, toxic sites etc
-   Tabular data \[eg value of improveements, use code, etc\]
-   Tax collector data
-   Zoning, road access, access to water,
-   Hen Foundation, Noisebridge
-   Set up payment plan
-   Loans for the non-profit
-   Scope the potential properties thoroughly
-   Participation with the surrounding community
-   Development
    -   Many of the properties are mix-zoned
-   Couple shipping containers, maybe 4 tiny homes, gardens / landscaping, and some tents
-   Under 30k is the goal
-   Needs hosting for qGIS data
-   Collect data on the properties from the County Office, Building Safety - name & address of property owner
    -   Permits, code violations, etc
    -   County Recorder's office for documents

SKD (Sofa King Duet)
====================

-   Could we use one of the offices available connected to sudo's common room to launch a coworking space/business? Budget: 2k(ish)/month

Interpersonal Ecosystem
=======================

-   Essentially - hate to say it - a Facebook for hackers \[<http://github.com/em-che>| like github?\]
-   This clearly ties in to Mycelia - how to implement on the UI level? --&gt; Hack night
-   Project-based system (again see Mycelia) that serves as a matchmaking platform between people, project, skills, ideas, spaces, etc
-   More on focused convo to come!
