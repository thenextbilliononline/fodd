#### Sub-Section 3.6.0 Assets

-   **sudo room** assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.

#### Sub-Section 3.6.1 Budgeting

**sudo room** employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

1.  Determine if membership dues can be reduced
2.  Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
3.  Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as *internal credits* (or a *soft dividend*) available for members to:
    1.  Leave to the discretion of **sudo room** to allocate
    2.  Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available **internal projects** as defined below.
    3.  Provide as future contributions to membership dues.

-   **Note:** there is a substantial distinction for *external projects* as defined below.

<!-- -->

-   To ensure stability, **sudo room** must maintain several standing funds:
    -   3 months worth of rent + utilities
    -   Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
    -   Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
    -   Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

#### Sub-Section 3.6.2 Income

**sudo room** accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

#### Sub-Section 3.6.3 Dues

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

-   dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
    -   For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

#### Sub-Section 3.6.4 Expenditures

-   Internal Projects
    -   Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
    -   Capital Projects
-   External Projects
    -   Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.

#### Sub-Section 3.6.5 Surplus

**sudo room** strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.

-   Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds
