Article 2. Membership
---------------------

### Section 2.0 Definition

### Section 2.1 Qualifications for Membership

-   Membership is defined by fulfilling the following requirements:
    1.  Contributing monthly dues (sliding-scale with respect to operating costs) or equivalent.
        -   It is an express purpose of the group to keep membership rates low, and therefore accessible, as well as offer, when possible, alternatives to monetary contribution to suffice for monthly dues.
    2.  A status of good standing with the organization.
        -   Unresolved debts and/or substantial lapses in respecting the values of the organization and its members may result in suspension of membership, to be determined by fair process respecting individual rights and freedoms and the integrity of community norms.

### Section 2.2 Sudo Functionaries

As a collective, functionary positions are voluntary roles taken on by willing members and intended to change regularly. No person may hold more than one position simultaneously, unless permitted by **sudo room**. Any member of sudoroom may perform any of the functions of any of the Functionaries, but the Functionaries are expected to perform their duties regularly and must perform them if no one else can or will.

### Section 3.4 Enforcement

#### Sub-Section 3.4.0 Process

The resolution of disputes and disagreements within **sudo room** is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:

1.  The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as Constable in the matter, and works with this Constable to find a Mediator.
    1.  The Mediator is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work with towards a solution.
    2.  The Constable organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
    3.  The Constable, Mediator, and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to the conflict that all conflicting parties consent to.
2.  If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the Constable and Mediator agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
    1.  The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and all relevant documentation is gathered together by the Constable and made available to the group at least one week beforehand, preferably on the wiki, and notice is broadcast to the group, preferably on the mailing list, but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of redress sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the Constable and Mediator must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the Constable and Mediator must expressly affirm that the form of redress sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with **sudo room's** values. The request for redress must include an implementation plan approved by the Constable and the Mediator if it is not obvious how to implement it.
    2.  During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
        1.  First, the Constable presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
        2.  Then, a category of severity is established by **consensus** according to **sudo room**'s values and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
            1.  Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
                -   **Decision Procedure:** 2/3 vote
            2.  Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
                -   **Decision Procedure:** 1/2 vote
            3.  All other conflicts.
                -   **Decision Procedure:** Consensus
        3.  Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the Mediator, and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The Constable co-facilitates with the Facilitator in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
        4.  Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
        5.  Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, preferably but not necessarily along with implementation plans if appropriate, which are added to a list of potential remedies if neither the Constable nor the Mediator objects. They may be overruled in their objections if a second member supports the proposal.
        6.  Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the one under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The Constable then works with all relevant parties to implement the remedy or remedies that passed according to their implementation plans, and also to develop plans for remedies proposed during the meeting without plans if needed.
        7.  Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to values that were not served by the original decision.
        8.  If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

#### Sub-Section 3.4.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts

1.  The accused are presumed innocent unless and until proven otherwise beyond reasonable doubt.
2.  Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members is consistently maintained.
3.  Proportional and effective remedies should be sought.
4.  [Restorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice) remedies are strongly preferred over [retributive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice) remedies.

### Section 3.5 Corporate and Tax Status

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

### Section 3.6 Fiscal Solvency

[FYI, here are the fiscal solvency sheets ya'll](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At_6qzhQZBX8dHU0bWZaNkxpSkcyeG5WMVRwMVQ4aWc#gid=4)

#### Sub-Section 3.6.0 Assets

-   **sudo room** assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.

#### Sub-Section 3.6.1 Budgeting

**sudo room** employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

1.  Determine if membership dues can be reduced
2.  Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
3.  Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as *internal credits* (or a *soft dividend*) available for members to:
    1.  Leave to the discretion of **sudo room** to allocate
    2.  Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available **internal projects** as defined below.
    3.  Provide as future contributions to membership dues.

-   **Note:** there is a substantial distinction for *external projects* as defined below.

<!-- -->

-   To ensure stability, **sudo room** must maintain several standing funds:
    -   3 months worth of rent + utilities
    -   Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
    -   Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
    -   Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

#### Sub-Section 3.6.2 Income

**sudo room** accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

#### Sub-Section 3.6.3 Dues

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

-   dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
    -   For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

#### Sub-Section 3.6.4 Expenditures

-   Internal Projects
    -   Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
    -   Capital Projects
-   External Projects
    -   Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.

#### Sub-Section 3.6.5 Surplus

**sudo room** strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.

-   Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds
