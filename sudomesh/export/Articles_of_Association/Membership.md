Proposal:
=========

-   That membership requires a minimum fee of $10 per month. (See \[<https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association/Minimum_Dues> Hol's proposal up for consensus)
-   That membership includes 24/7 access to the space with a personal access code and/or rfid.
-   That members don't ever have to show up in person if they don't want voting rights.
-   To empower members to deal with problematic non-members, non-members can be thrown out at any time by a member if that members feel they are being a problem, _unless_ some other member present in the space is willing to vouch for the member as a guest. Non-members being asked to leave must be told that they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list.
-   Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and have to leave when the last member leaves.
