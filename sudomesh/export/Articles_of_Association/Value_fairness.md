### Section 3.2 Conflict Resolution

#### Sub-Section 3.2.0 Process

[400px|right|Diagram](/File:SudoRoom.png "wikilink") The resolution of disputes and disagreements within **sudo room** is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:

1.  The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as **Conflict Steward** in the matter, and works with this **Conflict Steward** to find a **Mediator**.
    1.  The **Mediator** is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
    2.  The **Conflict Steward** organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
    3.  The **Conflict Steward**, **Mediator**, and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
2.  If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the **Conflict Steward** and **Mediator** agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
    1.  The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the **Conflict Steward** and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the **Conflict Steward** and **Mediator** must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the **Conflict Steward** and **Mediator** must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with **sudo room's** [values](/Articles_of_Association#Values "wikilink"). The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the **Conflict Steward** and the **Mediator** if it is not obvious how to implement it.
    2.  During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
        1.  First, the **Conflict Steward** presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
        2.  Then, a category of severity is established by **consensus** according to **sudo room**'s [values](/Articles_of_Association#Values "wikilink") and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
            1.  Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
                -   **Decision Procedure:** 2/3 vote
            2.  Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
                -   **Decision Procedure:** 1/2 vote
            3.  All other conflicts.
                -   **Decision Procedure:** Consensus
        3.  Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the **Mediator**, and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The **Conflict Steward** co-facilitates with the **Facilitator** in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
        4.  Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
        5.  Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
        6.  Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The **Conflict Steward** then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
        7.  Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [values](/Articles_of_Association#Values "wikilink") that were not served by the original decision.
        8.  If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

#### Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts

In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include:

1.  Presumption of innocence.
2.  Right to an appeal and a fair process.
3.  Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
4.  Proportional and effective remedies.
    1.  [Restorative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice) remedies are strongly preferred over [retributive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice) remedies.

### Section 3.3 Corporate and Tax Status

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

#### Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets

-   **sudo room** assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.

#### Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting

**sudo room** employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

1.  Determine if membership dues can be reduced
2.  Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
3.  Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as *internal credits* (or a *soft dividend*) available for members to:
    1.  Leave to the discretion of **sudo room** to allocate
    2.  Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available **internal projects** as defined below.
    3.  Provide as future contributions to membership dues.

-   **Note:** there is a substantial distinction for *external projects* as defined below.

<!-- -->

-   To ensure stability, **sudo room** must maintain several standing funds:
    -   3 months worth of rent + utilities
    -   Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
    -   Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
    -   Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

#### Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income

**sudo room** accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

#### Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues

Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

-   dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
-   For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

#### Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures

-   Internal Projects
    -   Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
    -   Capital Projects
-   External Projects
    -   Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.

#### Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus

**sudo room** strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.

-   Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds
