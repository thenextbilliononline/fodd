First Response Oakland is a grassroots initiative to cultivate a network of coordinated response and aid for emergency and disaster preparedness. To this end, we seek to:

-   learn essential skills for how to protect yourself and your community in the event of an emergency (earthquake, tsunami, fire, paramilitary attacks, etc;)
-   build human and communications infrastructure
-   map local resources and skilled professionals
-   create evacuation plans
-   build home emergency kits and mobile kits (in the case of immediate evacuation)

Our first event will be a CORE I training on February 21st, outlined here: <http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OFD/s/CORE/OAK026258>

**Please sign up for this event in advance at the [CORE I RSVP](/CORE_I_RSVP "wikilink") page!**
