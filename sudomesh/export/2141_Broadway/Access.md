This page details the preferred access scheme for Sudo Room's location at 2141 Broadway in downtown Oakland.

Sudoers are provided with entrance to Sudo Room, the common space adjacent to Sudo Room, and the bathrooms shared on the 2nd floor.

To enter, Sudoers use the side-door on 22nd between Broadway and Telegraph. This door currently requires a physical key, but will soon be electrified.

Then, Sudoers take the elevator at the end of the hallway to reach the 2nd floor common room and entrance to Sudo Room. This door can be opened with a physical key, but Sudoers use a numerical keypad with individual passcodes.
