How to Make A Free Zinebook
---------------------------

[thumb|This image shows how anyone can make a free 8-page book from a single side sheet of 8.5" x 11" paper. The paper can have writing or anything on the back, and is completed within a minute using no necessary tools. Enjoy the artwork! Pens, markers, pencil, colored pencils, paints, or whatever works for you.](/File:How_To_Make_a_Free_Zinebook.jpg "wikilink")

Materials required: 1 (one) 8.5" x 11" sheet of paper, single side. This paper can be recycled if needed if it was used on one side. Eg. only one side will be needed for the design. Design also works for other sizes of paper.

Tools required: Scissors, optional

Steps:

1. Fold the piece of paper in half horizontally, or “hamburger style.” Unfold the paper.

2. Fold both edges of the paper into the center crease you just made. Unfold the paper.

3. Your next fold is “hotdog style,” or a fold length-wise across the paper. Unfold the paper.

4. Next, tear or cut along the middle line between the first and fourth “quarters.” (The line “4” in the photo.)

5. Finally, in order to form the book you pull both middle sections out, and form your blank booklet.

Enjoy the blank booklet! You can decorate as desired. The design is replicable and appropriate for non-hierarchical communications in your purposes. Enjoy!!!!
