Our active projects include making small batches of Kombucha and building a temperature monitor using a Raspberry PI. Got other ideas? Bring 'em by!

We are working out of “Room 1” on the CCL side of the Bocce Room shared by Sudo Room and CCL. When you enter the building from the door at the corner of Shattuck and 48th, you will enter into a room that was formerly a bar and has mirrored walls on one side. Walk to the end of the room through the open door, and make a left. You have arrived! :D
