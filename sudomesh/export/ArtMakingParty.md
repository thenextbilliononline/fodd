About
-----

The Art Making Party is a monthly event at SudoRoom.

It occurs right as the First Friday Oakland Art Murmur ends. The theme switches out but the focus centers on the act of making art.

There are MCs, performers, and so on but the focus isn't on them. It is on the act of creation. The musicians act more as partners with the guests, enabling them to react and make art.
