The [CORE](http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OFD/s/CORE/index.htm) I course will be offered at Sudo Room on Thursday, Feb. 21st from 6:30-9:30pm.

The CORE I class teaches students how to prepare a family disaster plan, reduce common household hazards, create emergency supply kits, and respond to a number of possible emergencies, including earthquakes and fires.

From the [website](http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OFD/s/CORE/index.htm):


"CORE is a free training program for individuals, neighborhood groups and community-based organizations in Oakland. The underlying premise is that a major disaster will overwhelm first responders leaving many citizens on their own for the first seven to 10 days after the emergency.

<!-- -->


CORE teaches self-reliance skills and helps neighborhoods establish response teams to take care of the neighborhood until professional emergency personnel arrive."

This is the first in a series of three classes. In the CORE II class, folks learn how to organize a neighborhood command post and create emergency response teams, (i.e. communications, damage assessment, hazard reduction/utilities, search and rescue, disaster first aid, shelter and special needs).
