Decoration of SudoRoom
----------------------

By the end of the day we'd like to hang up some comics in the space to spruce it up.

Hardware
--------

-   Giant roll out scrolls of paper 20 feet long that we can draw a big comic on!
-   Wacom Bamboo Tablet
-   3D Printer

Schedule
--------

-   Roll out a big roll of paper
-   People draw their characters interacting (1 or more characters per artist)
-   We scan the drawing
-   We fuse the scan onto a 3D Model using the customizable Lithopane onThingiverse - <http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:74322>
-   Print out the lithopane on the 3D Printer
    -   Warning - this might take a while (at least 20-30 minutes?)
