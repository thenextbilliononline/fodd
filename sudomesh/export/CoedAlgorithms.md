This is also hand in hand with our sister hackrrspace Noisebridge Coed Algorithm Class

*Algorithms are beautiful, and they shouldn't just be to pass a class or to ace a coding interview*

-   Notes & Github repo: <https://github.com/romyilano/AlgorithmsCoed>
-   Events: Sundays 2-4pm at Noisebridge, off an on at SudoRoom

While this usually happens at Noisebridge, the SudoRoom study groups will involve more drawing and art and poetry. Maybe even some social activism interwoven into the code!
