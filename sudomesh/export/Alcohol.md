[thumb|250px|right](/File:keeping_it_weird_booze.jpg "wikilink") Alcohol at Sudo Room. This page is intended as a digital meeting room for us to converse about alcohol consumption at Sudo Room and other broader issues that come up during the exploration. What questions come to mind when thinking about alcohol consumption and safe space? Do you have any doubts, proposals, questions or proclamations? Please let us all know!

**Legal implications**
----------------------

-   Is there any particular risk that Sudo Room, as an unincorporated entity, holds should there be a negative and/or police/medics-involved event related to alcohol consumption there?
-   Space Federation is working on compiling legal documents for creating policies and reporting accidents in hackerspaces. If we end up drafting some documents, we could use [their working documents](https://atrium.schoolfactory.org/spacefed/node/107778) for inspiration and extend them.
    -   The Ace Monster Toys wiki's “[Becoming a Member](http://wiki.acemonstertoys.org/Becoming_a_Member)” page has potentially relevant documents, such as a *Liability Waiver*, *Membership Agreement* and *Emergency Contact Form*.

**Human implications**
----------------------

-   Should sudoers have the freedom to drink with one another to promote friendship as is customary in society?
    -   The general (unofficial) consensus at the Wednesday (Jan. 30th 2013) meeting was that there is no push to ban alcohol consumption in Sudo Room. [Vicky](/User:Bleeblahblue "wikilink") ([talk](/User_talk:Bleeblahblue "wikilink")) 08:57, 3 February 2013 (UTC)
    -   If we invite students in for after-school activities, then it would be wise not to have alcohol available
-   What should we do should someone inside of Sudo Room suffer from alcohol poisoning? This question should also be more broadly interpreted for other medical/psychiatric emergencies.
    -   Do we have any regular members who have emergency medical/psychiatric training? [thumb|right|**Snake wine, anyone?**](/File:vietnamese_snake_wine.jpg "wikilink")
        -   [First Response Oakland](/First_Response_Oakland "wikilink") (tentative name) is an effort to connect sudo room to information, training, and contacts for coordinating an emergency / crisis response network in Oakland.
    -   Where are our first aid supplies? You can find them in the upper left-hand cabinet above the sink in sudo room proper. The cabinet is marked with a red cross and the words 'First Aid Kit.' What elements are missing?

**Questions, etc. that don't fit the Legal-Human duality**
----------------------------------------------------------

-   Think about providing non-alcoholic beverages for Hacker Happy Hour!
-   Brew more kombucha (doesn't *really* count!! Added bonus: delicious.)
    -   How does kombucha not really count? It is a delicious carbonated alternative to beer, wine, and liquor. [Tunabananas](/User:Tunabananas "wikilink") ([talk](/User_talk:Tunabananas "wikilink")) 01:51, 22 November 2013 (PST)
