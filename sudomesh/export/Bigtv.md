this is a raspberry pi running the default OS connected to the big TV on the wall in sudoroom

its IP address is fixed at 100.64.64.27 (see <https://sudoroom.org/wiki/network> to be sure)

jake set it up

commands in ~/bin include speak, which makes espeak work despite the hardware bug that cuts off the beginning of speech when you don't use aplay

another command is mainscreenturnon which unblanks the screensaver.

when sudobot (in irc) sees you type !say it will cause this computer to speak
