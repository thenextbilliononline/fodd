Questions for SudoRoom.org

Commons film – December 2013

Sudo Room Request
-----------------

We are currently awaiting the director's response to our request that any footage of sudo room/sudoers be made CC, CC-BY, or CC-BY-SA.

Documentary Response
--------------------

All video filmed of Sudo Room will be [online](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gs5yobur2898m85/Gu9tpyAVJA) for pending review of members. If any content is questionable for use in the documentary please contact Bunker.

I currently am looking at: “Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)” licensing

<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en_US> - human-readable plain summary

<http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode> - license

Here are our concerns:

1.  As long as we can distribute the film, Creative Commons licensing looks appropriate.
2.  Most important: Many people appear in the film, so our treatment of them is a huge concern for me. With CC licensing can we be sure that they are treated with great respect, if we share this widely and allow others rights to create derivative material?
3.  For example, what if a political satirist mocks somebody using our material?
4.  Making money is less important, but is still very helpful. It would be nice to have a license that allowed us to represent that we own the film.

Questions
=========

Online freedoms
---------------

1. What is currently happening to free expression online?

2. Who is reducing online free expression?

3. How do they do that?

4. Who is affected by reducing online freedoms? What users, in what ways?

5. Do you have a graphic or visual way of depicting NSA/Government Surveillance?

Walk-through of the points where surveillance could happen
----------------------------------------------------------

6. Can you walk us through surveillance, starting from outside wiring, through connections, to a computer, how people might be under surveillance? Wires/fibre, cell towers, connection boxes, WiFi router signals, modems, computers, phones, visually showing them... (NOTE: If possible, try to show points along the fibre/wire transmission starting from connections outside a building, walking us through to an inside computer...).

SudoRoom.org
------------

1. Please tell us about SudoRoom.org.

2. Why do you personally find it important to support SudoRoom?

3. What drives your personal interest in action?

4. Why was SudoRoom needed?

5. Who participates in SudoRoom – physically? Online?

6. Why do they help?

7. What does SUDO mean? What does it represent as a name for the organization?

SudoRoom projects
-----------------

Please show it only if it can be publicly depicted:

1. Please walk us through a few SudoRoom projects – if they can be shown in a public film. (NOTE: please try show as much visually as possible so those outside the IT community can understand it).

2. Can you show the physical making of the devices that SudoRoom makes, keeping in mind that this is a public film?

Commons and SudoRoom’s work
---------------------------

16. Successful Commoners often have a core service they provide to support themselves. What does/could SudoRoom provide?

Request
-------

17. What would you ask of others watching this film, who may be considering taking action to help the situation in their own ways?

Original Invitation/Request
===========================

Hello Sudo Room,

My name is Bunker and I'm part of a documentary team from the east coast making a film about the 'Commons'. We're interested in filming your organization over the next few weeks and wanted to know a good way to get in touch with you.

My information is below and you can get in touch with me anytime.

The film is about reintroducing the idea of the commons to the general public, the idea that communities should be in charge of their resources.

`It's a film that shows how privatization of people's needs has lead to`

many of the major problems we face today in the United States. Throughout the past 5 year's we've filmed all over the United States talking to experts on the commons, showing how the commons have been taken away from us and also showing people who are bringing them back.

We believe that Sudo Room is a great example of brining back the digital commons to the local community of Oakland. It's a fantastic thing you're doing and we're really excited to have the opportunity to see your space and interview some of your members.

Most of all we want to film during times of action. Any events and projects that we can film that are coming up would be great.

Thanks a lot, hope to hear from you soon, -bunker -- BunkerFilms.com +1 215 971 0837 skype: bunkof
