Protocol
--------

-   Plan is to only meet during official sudo room meetings, simply requiring that we have board members show up (enough for quorum).
-   No need to meet separately, unless a particular circumstance requires it.
-   Get things done but keep things interesting through movement, art and entertainment like meeting nude at Korean bathhouses in San Leandro

History
-------

-   Sudo Room has incorporated with the state of California as a Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation organized for public and charitable purposes
    -   Followed these instructions <http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/filing-tips-corp.htm#artsnp>
    -   The specific purpose of this corporation is to promote and encourage scientific, technical, engineering and artistic skills through individual projects, social collaboration, and education. In the context of these purposes, the corporation shall engage in scientific, charitable and educational activities within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.
