Mark your calendars! Cyberwizard institute is coming back this August! Join us for a nighttime and weekends edition. Current plan: starts August 1st (Saturday) at 15:00 and goes through Aug 15.

This time, we'll start later on the weekdays so that people can drop in after work and also have content on weekends in the afternoon.
