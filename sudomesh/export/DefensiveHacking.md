Overview
========

Current security mechanisms at SudoRoom

-   SudoRoom [Door Access](/Door_Access "wikilink")

Questions
---------

Just like the oil tribe in Max Max, Sudo Room must learn to protect itself from hostile outside elements without becoming hostile itself.

-   How can Sudo Room protect its wiki from spam?
-   How can SudoRoom improve the safety of guests, members and citizens living in this slice of Oakland?
-   How can we enlist the help of talented hackers to protect us from hostile outside hackers?
-   How can we protect Sudo Room from fungus and mold? They're huge problems! They kill more people than hackers!

We all know super smart people. Wouldn't this be a chance for them to show off how clever they are at being hackers?
