BYLAWS OF SUDO ROOM

A California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation

Inspiration
===========

-   [Noisebridge's Bylaws](https://www.noisebridge.net/images/4/4a/Noisebridge_bylaws_020090206.pdf)
-   [Counter Culture Lab's articles of incorporation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JgmxLhml0mWdItLkjkTr8VP0tGhPfxWbSIfmblSYVCo/edit#heading=h.wxoqd3ooeghl)

Things we may want to change
============================

Throughout
----------

### 501(c) References

In order to provide maximum flexibility in federal tax structure, should change references to 501(c)(3) below. Certainly these articles are to be formed ASAP in order to avoid hindering progress in collaboration with other entities like Counter Culture Labs and The Public School. However, it is not an immediate requirement to resolve federal tax status to do that (though it should be done soon). So, with a few minor adjustments, it is possible to ensure we may potentially incorporate as a 501(c)(4), 501(c)(8), 501(c)(10), or other. There are a few ways to do this.

Options:

-   One approach is to list all applicable options
    -   Example: <http://caminowoodsii.org/documents/articles.html>
-   Another is to ensure references to 501(c)(3) are augmented to be relevant to 501(c) statuses in general.
    -   Seems like this is possible since the language used for our particular purposes are general enough to fit within all of the relevant statuses anyhow, so I think we run little risk.
-   Eliminate specific references to 501(c) statues entirely, but keep the appropriate components that would be applicable in particular.
    -   Counter Culture Labs has largely done this with only two actual references to 501(c)(3).

Article 3
---------

This is about our purpose and values. We can and should more or less freely change 3.1 and 3.2, but 3.3 should remain unchanged.

Article 6.1
-----------

A member is proposed for membership by one existing member. Do we want to change this to two?

Article 12
----------

Insurance. This sections says that “This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law”. Maybe we want to drop the “and shall use its best efforts” part?

===============

The name of this corporation is sudo room.

Article 2. Principal Office of the Corporation
==============================================

    Address:                Date:
    Address:                Date:
    Address:                Date:

Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as any other validly approved action of the board. All such consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.

7.9. Compensation and Reimbursement

Appointments to committees of the board shall be by majority vote of the directors then in office. The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting. Any such committee shall have all the authority of the board, to the extent provided in the board resolution, except that no committee may do the following:


(a) Take any final action on any matter that, under the California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation Law, also requires approval of the members or approval of a majority of all members;

### b. Audit Committee

The corporation may have an audit committee consisting of at least two directors, and may include nonvoting advisors. Directors who are employees or officers of the corporation or who receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the corporation (other than for service as director) may not serve on the audit committee. If established, the audit committee shall perform the duties and adhere to the guidelines set forth in the corporation's audit committee charter as amended from time to time by the board. Such duties include, but are not limited to:


(a) Assisting the board in choosing an independent auditor and recommending termination of the auditor, if necessary;

(b) Negotiating the auditor's compensation;

(c) Conferring with the auditor regarding the corporation's financial affairs; and

(d) Reviewing and accepting or rejecting the audit.

Members of the audit committee shall not receive compensation for their service on the audit committee in excess of that provided to directors for their service on the board.

### c. Compensation Committee

The corporation may have a compensation committee consisting of at least three directors and no one who is not a director. Directors who are also employees of the corporation may not serve on the compensation committee. Pursuant to Government Code section 12586(g) and the applicable provisions of federal law, if established, the compensation committee shall review the compensation of the president, chief financial officer, and such other officers of the corporation the compensation committee determines appropriate, annually and whenever a modification in compensation is proposed. Such a review shall include an evaluation of the performance of the officers and an analysis of appropriate comparability data. Based on its review (and existence), the compensation committee shall recommend just and reasonable compensation amounts for the officers to the board. At the request of the president or the board, the compensation committee shall review any issue involving staff compensation and benefits, including but not limited to housing, health, and retirement plans.

### d. Executive Committee

Pursuant to Section 7.10.a. of these bylaws, the board may appoint two or more directors of the corporation to serve as the executive committee of the board. The executive committee, unless limited by a resolution of the board, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the board in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation between meetings of the board; provided, however, that the executive committee shall not have the authority of the board in reference to those matters enumerated in Section 7.10.a. All actions of the executive committee shall be reported to and ratified by the full board at the next duly scheduled board meeting.

### e. Investment Committee

This corporation may have an investment committee comprised of no fewer than three directors. If established, the committee shall act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims to accomplish the purposes of the institution. Any individual investments shall be considered as part of an overall investment strategy. Such a committee shall consider present and future financial requirements, expected total return, general economic conditions, the appropriate level of risk, appropriate levels of income, growth and long-term net appreciation, and the probable safety of the funds. The committee may retain professional money managers, and shall develop an investment policy that shall be reconsidered at feast annually, in light of the changing needs of the corporation, economic conditions, and any other factors that may affect the corporation's tolerance of risk and need for income. The committee may recommend the retention of property contributed by a donor (whether or not it produces income), and a donor's request should be a factor in making the determination of whether to sell a particular asset contributed by a donor.

### f. Meetings and Action of Committees

Meetings and actions of committees of the board shall be governed by, held, and taken under the provisions of these bylaws concerning meetings and other board actions, except that the time for general meetings of such committees and the calling of special meetings of such committees may be set either by board resolution or, if none, by resolution of the committee. Minutes of each meeting shall be kept and shall be filed with the corporate records. The board may adopt rules for the governance of any committee as long as the rules are consistent with these bylaws. If the board has not adopted rules, the committee may do so.

Article 9. Contracts With Directors
===================================

No director of this corporation nor any other corporation, firm, association, or other entity in which one or more of this corporation's directors are directors or have a material financial interest, shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction with this corporation, unless (a) the material facts regarding that director's financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership, or financial interest are fully disclosed in good faith and noted in the minutes, or are known to all members of the board prior to the board's consideration of such contract or transaction; (b) such contract or transaction is authorized in good faith by a majority of the board by a vote sufficient for that purpose without counting the votes of the interested directors; (c) before authorizing or approving the transaction, the board considers and in good faith decides after reasonable investigation that the corporation could not obtain a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort under the circumstances; and (d) the corporation for its own benefit enters into the transaction, which is fair and reasonable to the corporation at the time the transaction is entered into.

This Section does not apply to a transaction that is part of an educational or charitable program of this corporation if it (a) is approved or authorized by the corporation in good faith and without unjustified favoritism and (b) results in a benefit to one or more directors or their families because they are in the class of persons intended to be benefited by the educational or charitable program of this corporation,

Article 10. Loans to Directors and Officers
===========================================

This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer without the approval of the California Attorney General, provided, however, that the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of his or her duties if that director or officer would be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses by the corporation.

Article 11. Indemnification
===========================

To the fullest extent permitted by law, this corporation shall indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and other persons described in Corporations Code section 5238(a), including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any “proceeding,” as that term is used in that section, and including an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person described in that section. “Expenses,” as used in this bylaw, shall have the same meaning as in that section of the Corporations Code. On written request to the board by any person seeking indemnification under Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) the board shall promptly decide under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) has been met and, if so, the board shall authorize indemnification. If the board cannot authorize indemnification, because the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not parties to that proceeding, the board shall promptly call a meeting of members. At that meeting, the members shall determine under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the members present at the meeting in person or by proxy shall authorize indemnification.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise determined by the board in a specific instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under Article 11 of these bylaws in defending any proceeding covered by that Section shall be advanced by the corporation before final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person that the advance will be repaid unless it is ultimately found that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for those expenses.

Article 12. Insurance
=====================

This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law on behalf of its officers, directors, employees, and other agents, to cover any liability asserted against or incurred by any officer, director, employee, or agent in such capacity or arising from the officer's, director's, employee's, or agent's status as such.

Article 13. Maintenance of Corporate Records
============================================

This corporation shall keep the following:


(a) Adequate and correct books and records of account;

(b) Minutes of the proceedings of its members, board, and committees of the board; and

(c) A record of each member's name, address, and class of membership.

The minutes and other books and records shall be kept either in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form or in any combination of the two.

Article 14. Inspection Rights
=============================

14.1. Members' Right to Inspect
-------------------------------

### a. Membership Records

Unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative as provided below, any member may do either or both of the following for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member:

-   (1) Inspect and copy the records containing members' names, addresses, and voting rights during usual business hours on five days' prior written demand on the corporation, which must state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
-   (2) Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, on written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of names, addresses, and voting rights of members who are entitled to vote for directors as of the most recent record date for which that list has been compiled, or as of the date, after the date of demand, specified by the member. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The secretary shall make this list available to the member on or before the later of ten days after the demand is received or the date specified in the demand as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.

The corporation may, within ten business days after receiving a demand under this Section, make a written offer of an alternative method of reasonable and timely achievement of the proper purpose specified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. Any rejection of this offer must be in writing and must state the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.

If the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for a purpose other than one reasonably related to a person's interest as a member, or if it provides a reasonable alternative under this Section, it may deny the member access to the membership list. Any inspection and copying under this Section may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.

### b. Accounting Records and Minutes

On written demand on the corporation, any member may inspect, copy, and make extracts of the accounting books and records and the minutes of the proceedings of the members, the board of directors, and committees of the board at any reasonable time for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member. Any such inspection and copying may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.

### c. Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws

This corporation shall keep at its principal California office the original or a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date, which shall be open to inspection by the members at all reasonable times during office hours. If the corporation has no business office in California, the secretary shall, on the written request of any member, furnish to that member a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date.

14.2. Directors' Right to Inspect
---------------------------------

Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect the corporation's books, records, documents of every kind, physical properties, and the records of each subsidiary. The inspection may be made in person or by the director's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts of documents,

Article 15. Required Reports
============================

15.1. Annual Report
-------------------

The board shall cause an annual report to be sent to the members and directors within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year. That report shall contain the following information, in appropriate detail:


(a) The assets and liabilities, including the trust funds, of the corporation as of the end of the fiscal year;

(b) The principal changes in assets and liabilities, including trust funds;

(c) The corporation's revenue or receipts, both unrestricted and restricted to particular purposes;

(d) The corporation's expenses or disbursements for both general and restricted purposes;

(e) Any information required by Section 14.1.c. of these bylaws; and

(f) An independent accountants' report or, if none, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the corporation's books and records.

This requirement of an annual report shall not apply if the corporation receives less than $25,000 in gross receipts during the fiscal year, provided, however, that the information specified above for inclusion in an annual report must be furnished annually to all directors and to any member who requests it in writing. If the board approves, the corporation may send the report and any accompanying material sent pursuant to this section by electronic transmission.

15.2. Annual Statement of Certain Transactions and Indemnifications
-------------------------------------------------------------------

As part of the annual report to all members, or as a separate document if no annual report is issued, the corporation shall, within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year, annually prepare and mail, deliver, or send by electronic transmission to each member and furnish to each director a statement of any transaction or indemnification of the following kind:


(a) Any transaction


(i) in which the corporation, or its parent or subsidiary, was a party,

(ii) in which an “interested person” had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and

(iii) which involved more than $50,000 or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000. For this purpose, an “interested person” is either


(1) any director or officer of the corporation, its parent or subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or

(2) any holder of more than 10 percent of the voting power of the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary. The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to the corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.

(b) Any indemnifications or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation under Article 11 of these bylaws, unless that indemnification has already been approved by the members under Corporations Code section 5238(e)(2).
