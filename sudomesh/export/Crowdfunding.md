Announcement
------------

Tech Liminal Lunch Box Crowdfunding. Wed., Apr. 17, 2013.

Crowdfunding. What does it mean and how does it work? Why is it the biggest buzz word since social media? Will it really circumvent the flow of investment capital to bypass Wall Street? Can it stimulate new jobs in the small business enterprise and contractors markets?

Is there anything more to this than passing around a hat for donations amongst your friends and family in order to do a project you and they know will never be completed? What is the Securities Exchange Commission worried about that is delaying their implementation of the Crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act, which was supposed to go into effect in January?

At Lunch Box, we will address these questions, or at the very least read all of them out loud.

Bring your own lunch box.
