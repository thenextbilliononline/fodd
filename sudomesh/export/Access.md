{*not to be confused with [Door Access](/Door_Access "wikilink")*}

The barrier to entry to Sudo Room is intended to be very low. Sudo Room is committed to public access: the ability for the public to visit at all times that members are present, and to utilize Sudo Room's resources for community improvement (especially along the lines of [Sudo Room values](/Articles_of_Association "wikilink")). Sudo Room is open 24/7, but in reality is open whenever members are present (which is typically from about 9AM to 2AM).

Accessibility/Disability
------------------------

La Commune Cafe and Bookstore, Rise Above Graphics, **Sudo Room** and Counter Culture Labs are all wheelchair-accessible on the ground floor. The ballroom is accessible via a wheelchair lift via La Commune. The doorway to the Ticket Booth Room has been widened to enable wheelchair access.

Unfortunately, we do not currently have an ADA-accessible bathroom. The bathroom connected to La Commune is currently being renovated to become a single-occupancy ADA bathroom, but we have some work to do until it's complete. The bathroom in the hallway leading to Sudo Room and Counter Culture Labs is single-occupancy and can be utilized by those with some limited mobility.

We plan to have the ADA bathroom completed by November 15th. Long-term plans include an elevator lift to the basement and upstairs areas.
