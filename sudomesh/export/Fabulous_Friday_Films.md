Fundraising ideas
-----------------

-   How do we use films (and other events) as a means to raise funds?
    -   Suggested donation'': sliding scale $3 - $10

<!-- -->

-   How do we collect donations so that people who are inclined to donate can easily do so?
    -   Entrance/welcome booth with a person by the elevator to make suggested donation more visible than it usually is
    -   Use something more “official” than the typical glass jar
