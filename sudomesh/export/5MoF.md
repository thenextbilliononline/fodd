The sudo room five minutes of fame is a social event where a bunch of folks meet up and munch on snacks while some folks make short 5 minute presentations about projects they're working on or things they care about.

This type of event is blatantly stolen^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hheavily inspired by the noisebridge 5MoF events.

People are encouraged to bring snacks/food/drinks.

For speakers
============

We provide a stage with a small podium for a laptop, amplified microphone, spotlights and a projector.

We provide a laptop running lubuntu (with firefox) which is already hooked up to the projector, internet and audio. It has LibreOffice and the Eye of Gnome image viewer. You can either make you presentation available on the internet or on a USB stick. As you are setting up to speak please tell a volunteer if you plan to use audio from the laptop.

If you want to use your own laptop we provide the following connectors:

-   VGA and HDMI for projector hookup. If you need anything else then bring the appropriate adapter.
-   Ethernet for internet. Don't rely on wifi. If you don't have ethernet then bring the appropriate adapter.
-   Mini jack (3.5 mm TRRS) for audio output from your laptop.
-   Power

If you want to remote in, please email info@sudoroom.org before the event. You will need to use a WebRTC-based (web-based) video chat client which works in firefox and does not require any plugins to be installed nor any signup. Right now we're recommending [takly](https://talky.io/) but we're open to suggestions.

If you have any other needs, please contact info@sudoroom.org before the event.
