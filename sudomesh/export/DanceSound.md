Overview
========

Art, sound, dance and technology COLLIDE.

Members
-------

We are busily absorbing various groups from SudoRoom, Oakland and the Public School. We are interested in infusing art into technology.

Events
======

[May 3rd, 2013 - Circles & Dance Performance at the Berkeley Museum](/DanceSoundPerformanceMay "wikilink")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*SudoRoom will be performing a dance in circles of white at the Berkeley Museum. We will be wearing LED costumes. Open to all! Rehearsals are every Saturday at 6pm in SudoRoom.*

Inspiration
===========

-   SFSU Conceptual/Information Arts (the CIA !) - they are so smart!

-   <http://userwww.sfsu.edu/infoarts/cdmain/res/a511.research.syllabus.html> &lt;- unfortunately this professor died, but his class is so cool!

Patterns
========

**Happy Patterns**
------------------

People hacking things

Dancers speaking one on one with the LED people on interesting things they'd like to do

**Anti-Patterns**
-----------------

Pulling in too many readymade projects with readymade ideas made by other people not part of sudo room in a way that inhibits the creativity of the group.

It's probably not a good idea to involve Zumba, etc. or any franchise corporate fitness movement. They are heavily copyrighted and do not allow hacking / creative extensions.
