The [Business Model Canvas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas) is a way to think through how you

-   turn your idea into an activity that can sustain itself and
-   communicate its “business model” quickly, briefly, and simply.

Nine building blocks of the business model tell your story: Partners deliver Resources through Activities so you can transform them by creating Value. This affects your Cost Structure. Each Customer Segment receives value through Channels and builds a Relationship. This shapes your Revenue Streams. The canvas lets you flesh out each part and see how they relate to each other.

How to use the Business Model Canvas
------------------------------------

1.  Draw the 9 blocks on a white board or big piece of paper.
2.  Put post-it notes, placeholder language, and quick sketches in each block
3.  Visualize how the blocks interact and adjust your model
4.  Take snapshots before and after major changes
5.  Color code post-its or markers to a particular customer segment
