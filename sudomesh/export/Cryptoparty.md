Every Third Sunday of the month from 2-5pm, Sudo Room hosts an afternoon of co-learning and teaching about digital security. The driving motivation of our cryptoparties is to learn about end-user security in a fun, welcoming and inclusive environment. Popular topics include: why digital security is important; strategies for activists and journalists; encrypted email; encrypted text messaging; encrypted phone calls; encrypting your hard drive; off-the-record instant messaging; secure web browsing; mesh networks; and presentations on newer projects. All skill levels welcome - bring your phone and/or laptop!

Hosting A Cryptoparty
=====================

-   Cryptoparties are best when some planning takes place before. Hold a planning meeting 1-2 weeks before the event and ping the [mailing list](https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/cryptoparty) to recruit folks who've expressed interest in helping out.
-   There are handouts linked to above that can be printed out at sudo - they generally live in a clear document holder / trapper keeper labelled 'Cryptoparty' located in a crate of other trapper keepers on the middle shelf between the workshop and the bike station in sudo.
-   Try to reach out to communities that should be using crypto and are generally not connected to the sudo room social network. Activists, journalists, immigrants + expats, POC, etc; Consider hosting the cryptoparty in an entirely different location.
-   At least a week before the cryptoparty, get the word out:
    -   Tweet/FB posts via Sudo Room's accounts (ask Jenny for info)
    -   Send an announcement to the following mailing lists:
        -   [sudo-discuss](https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/sudo-discuss)
        -   [cryptoparty](https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/cryptoparty)
        -   [noisebridge-discuss](https://lists.noisebridge.net/listinfo/noisebridge-discuss)
-   Come half an hour to an hour earlier to set up:
    -   Put the sudo room sandwich board out
    -   Tape up some signage on the doors if so inclined (there are some paper signs in the clear trapper keeper)
    -   Find a good spot for your expected \# of attendees. Check with Public School; often we have split up into several working groups using different areas of the common space, sudo room proper, and the public school room.
-   Starting the cryptoparty:
    -   Take notes on the wiki - set up a separate wiki page for that month's event \[eg; /wiki/Cryptoparty/YEAR/MONTHNAME
    -   Allow 15-30 minutes to get to a good group size to start
    -   Go around the room and ask folks to introduce themselves, their level of skill w/ crypto, what they're interested in discussing or working on that afternoon.
    -   Create an agenda ad-hoc and split the group as needed (pairs work great for things like helping someone set up disk encryption)
    -   Have fun! Encourage wide-ranging discussion but step in if things start to get to technical. Keep focus on those who are newer to the topic and have specific things they want to accomplish.
