      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2483">On November 6, 2013, a few Sudoers met up with the [http://theselc.org/cafe Sustainable Economies Law Center] at [http://oaklandmakerspace.wordpress.com/ LOL] with some legal questions regarding Incorporation, Board, and creating a &quot;Metacorporation&quot; with other legal entities with the purpose of co-owning a building. Below is a summary of some things we learned..

==Incorporation/Board==
''How best could we try to maintain a distributed power structure given the innate hierarchy of a 501c*?''
*The SELC is a 501c3 who had the same question. Part of how they try to distribute power is by practicing a '''[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holacracy Holacracy]''' (Wikipedia), whereby tasks and responsibilities are distributed between different self-organized working groups. We could research this and codify it into our corporation's bylaws.
*Form a non-profit cooperative? (we didn't get to talk about this, but it was mentioned)

''501c...WHICH?''
*A 501c3 is a good option, but only if we can explicitly prove that we serve a charitable or educational purpose. 
**We could show that we provide community economic development (a &quot;launching pad&quot;). 
**Colearning sessions such as our weekly meetups may not be able to qualify as &quot;educational&quot; because they would be seen as providing benefit to members and not the general public. This might just be a matter of how we frame it. Did I get this right, Juul?
*We may want to look into a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/501%28c%29#501.28c.29.284.29 501c4] (Civic Leagues, Social Welfare Organizations, and Local Associations of Employees), [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benefit_society  501c8]* (Benefit/Mutual Aid Society) and 501c10* (Domestic Fraternal Societies and Associations). *(''Eddan could possibly speak more on these'')

==METACORPORATION!!!==
*As a 501c3 or LLC, we could apply for ''welfare expemption'' and not have to pay property taxes. 
**''Example: The David Brower Center as a whole is able to qualify for a welfare exemption because a certain percentage of their renters are 501c3s. In other words, we could include other corporate entities in the shared building and qualify for a welfare exemption if we meet the baseline percentage (which was...?)''

==Recommended research==
*Non-profit/for-profit joint ventures: 
*Read [name of publication] by the Board of Equalization's publication on welfare property tax exemption (one of the SELC people is in the process of looking up the name of the resource for us).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="762">'''Note:''' This page refers to sudo room's previous location, so it is only maintained for historic purposes.

This page details the preferred access scheme for Sudo Room's location at 2141 Broadway in downtown Oakland. 

Sudoers are provided with entrance to Sudo Room, the common space adjacent to Sudo Room, and the bathrooms shared on the 2nd floor.

To enter, Sudoers use the side-door on 22nd between Broadway and Telegraph. This door currently requires a physical key, but will soon be electrified.

Then, Sudoers take the elevator at the end of the hallway to reach the 2nd floor common room and entrance to Sudo Room. This door can be opened with a physical key, but Sudoers use a numerical keypad with individual passcodes.

Possible share with Counter Culture Labs?

Landlord doesn't really care what we do and won't come bother us. He seems chill.

*1,500 sqft 1st floor (nice, bathroom, wheelchair accessible)
*1,500 sqft 2nd floor (tiny windy staircase, low ceiling, little light, water damage (but leaking fixed), kinda rough)
*2,000 sqft basement. (almost zero light. very rough ceiling. basement'y floor. does not smell musty. could be made wheelchair accessible with lift to sidewalk)

The water damage to the 2nd floor ceiling was caused by a leaking roof, but the roof has been replaced. There could be mold but nothing looked or smelled moldy or musty.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2718">This page is about creating models for 3D-printing. It's mostly geared towards Sudoers using our [[Type_A_Machine|Type-A Machine]] 3D printer, but models can be made by anyone anywhere, just like word documents don't have to be made on a machine attached to a 2D printer.

== STL Models ==

STL files are wireframe/polygonal representations of a 3D model. There's a number of ways to get them:

=== Write OpenSCAD (recommended) ===

[http://www.openscad.org/ OpenSCAD] is a programming language for describing 3D shapes. You write code on the left, and it renders your model on the right. Then you can export an STL file. It has many benefits:
* free, open source, cross-platform
* keyboard-centric, less mouse dragging
* your models are deterministic
* you can easily track your changes with git
* the [https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual manual] is pretty straightforward
* there's even a [http://openjscad.org/ browser javascript version]!

But the software still has a long way to go. Some annoying things about OpenSCAD:
* single-threaded rendering, so complex models take a long time
* no persistent cache, so if you close it, you must render all over again
* GUI blocks on rendering, so if your render takes too long you must kill it (save often)
* volatile syntax - for example, child() is deprecated in git master, but the alternative children() is not even supported by latest stable (2013.06)

=== Use other modeling software ===

* Google Sketchup is exceptionally easy to use because they profit when you map buildings for them.
* [http://tinkercad.com Tinkercad] (in Google Chrome)
* [http://blender.org Blender]

=== Download them ===

You can find premade STL files:
* On [http://thingiverse.com/ Thingiverse]
* On the [smb://space/sudoroom%20public%20data/Projects/3DPrinting local file server]
* On sudoroom's [https://github.com/sudoroom github] ([https://github.com/sudoroom/magnets magnets], [https://github.com/sudoroom/sudo-blocks blocks], etc)

== Slicing ==

3D Printers don't understand OpenSCAD or STL. They understand an extension of gcode, which is a decades-old language which sends direct instructions such as &quot;heat to 100 degrees, move here, do this, move there, do that, cool down&quot;. In order to print a model you have to turn it into a series of 2D layers or &quot;slices&quot;, using a program called a &quot;slicer&quot;. Slicers output gcode. They need to be configured for a particular printer, with settings such as melting tempurature, bed size, fill style, overhang compensation, etc. Examples of slicing software:
* Slic3r
* KISSlicer
* Skeinforge

Slicing for a particular machine such as our [[Type_A_Machine|Type-A]] should be documented at its own page.

For [[User:holmaschine|holmaschine]], the advantage of 3-D printed model rocket parts is the ability to create a very thin and structurally efficient shape without concern over fabrication and the relative alignments of subparts.  Components can be printed true to final form (+/-) with only light treatment required to smooth outer surfaces so long as the basic restrictions of the manufacturing method are understood.



'''Nose Cones'''

Several prototypes have been created in both 29mm and 65mm diameter, using a tangent-ogive profile.


TO DO: write code to generate g-code directly instead of using SolidWorks and Slic3r.

WHY: avoid 15 min + delay time using slicer, better match to theoretical shape without.


TO DO: Model payload supports integral with structural elements.

WHY: Reduce number of fasteners and/or adhesive required.


'''Fin Cans'''

One prototype printed, downrated to smaller engine size until proven.  Will mount adapter to aft bulkhead using (4) #4-40 screws.

= Actual Rocket =

The picture above shows a 3D printed 2-part rocket.  65mm max diameter, 29mm motor bay, tangent ogive curve with internal 2-way structural ribs and support for airspeed sensor pitot tube at nose. Made on [[Type_A_Machine|our Type-A Machine]].

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;SIGN UP NOW! [[5MoF 2017-06-14|Upcoming 5MoF: June 14, 2017 8:00pm]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The sudo room five minutes of fame is a social event where a bunch of folks meet up and munch on snacks while some folks make short 5 minute presentations about projects they're working on or things they care about.

This type of event is blatantly stolen^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hheavily inspired by the noisebridge 5MoF events.

People are encouraged to bring snacks/food/drinks.

= Schedule =

These events happen every first Wednesday of the month at sudo room!

Email info@sudoroom.org or [https://sudoroom.org/lists/listinfo/sudo-discuss the sudo room mailing list] to claim a slot for your project. All we need is the title of your presentation and a way to contact you.

7 minutes are allocated to each 5MoF presentation which includes 5 minutes for the presentation, time for questions and time for the next person to get their computer hooked up.

*7 pm: People shuffle in, snack on food and get settled
*7:30 pm: 1st 5MoF presentation 
*7:37 pm: 2nd 5MoF presentation
*7:44 pm: 3rd 5MoF presentation
*7:51 pm: 4th 5MoF presentation
*7:58 pm: 5th 5MoF presentation
*8:05 pm: 10 minute break (announced as a 5 minute break so we actually stay on time)
*8:15 pm: two-minute explanation of sudo room and the Omni. Donation hat passed around. New members encouraged to sign up right then and there. 
*8:18 pm: 6th 5MoF presentation - This is the remote presentation which gives time to set up the video conferencing during the break.
*8:25 pm: 7th 5MoF presentation
*8:32 pm: 8th 5MoF presentation
*8:39 pm: 9th 5MoF presentation
*8:46 pm: 10th 5MoF presentation
*8:53 pm: Announce https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoride for letting people ride-share back home.
*8:54 pm: Social hangouts and tour of omni for new folk.
*10:00 pm: Cleanup of food, chairs, etc. and moving folks to sudo room for continued hacking/socializing.

= For speakers =

We provide a stage with a small podium for a laptop, amplified microphone, spotlights and a projector. 

We provide a laptop running lubuntu (with firefox) which is already hooked up to the projector, internet and audio. It has LibreOffice and the Eye of Gnome image viewer. You can either make you presentation available on the internet or on a USB stick. As you are setting up to speak please tell a volunteer if you plan to use audio from the laptop.

If you want to use your own laptop we provide the following connectors:

* VGA and HDMI for projector hookup. If you need anything else then bring the appropriate adapter.
* Ethernet for internet. Don't rely on wifi. If you don't have ethernet then bring the appropriate adapter. 
* Mini jack (3.5 mm TRRS) for audio output from your laptop.
* Power

If you want to remote in, please email info@sudoroom.org before the event. You will need to use a WebRTC-based (web-based) video chat client which works in firefox and does not require any plugins to be installed nor any signup. Right now we're recommending [https://talky.io/ takly] but we're open to suggestions.

If you have any other needs, please contact info@sudoroom.org before the event.

== Full Floors with Common Space==

This proposal strives to create (on 3rd Floor) a shared common space, but also with enough space for each of the groups to split cost together fairly. Second floor could include other groups easily, including many already in contact with sudo room, etc.

* Floor 3: ~5,475 sqft
* Floor 2: ~2,350 sqft
* Total: ~7,825 sqft

[[File:8th and alice.png|floorplans for proposed rental]]

* https://sudoroom.org/wiki/File:8th_and_alice.pdf
* https://sudoroom.org/wiki/File:8th_and_alice.png

This space had been potentially available for rent starting about January 1st and is confirmed to be available as of Feb 26.

= Location = 

*Address: [http://osm.org/go/TZNQo9T6E-?m= 251 8TH ST, OAKLAND 94607]
*Two blocks from Lake Merritt BART
*Four blocks from Broadway
*In Chinatown
*Small Chinese grocery on 1st floor and a bigger grocery one block away.
*Restaurant (Cambodian) on 1st floor. 
:~$8 entrees. Other people viewing the space say it's really good.
*Free food: 7AM (be there by 7:15) breakfast, and 6:30 PM dinner (meets with the large group a little south) at 7th and Oak Sts. (Open Door)

= Photos =

*[http://imgur.com/a/b9Bsn juul's photos]

= Leaser =

The space is being managed and leased out by [http://www.creativedevelopmentpartners.com/ Creative Development Partners]. Need to verify, but previously, Jason Vargas (of CDP) worked with (or for?) the [http://ebaldc.org/ East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation (EBALDC)].

= History =

The space (top two floors) has not been used in &quot;15 years&quot;. Its last use was as a big sewing shop/factory (same usage as Noisebridge's space).

[[File:Elegance sewing co.jpg|thumb|business card of former business at [[8th and Alice]]]]

Apparently the previous owners passed the building on to their relation, current owner Connie K Young (~1994) so the evaluation hasn't changed since (~1969)? The contact for the property is:

::Eclipse Property Management, Inc
::1001 Marina Village Parkway, #115
::Alameda, CA 94501-1092

* Parcel Number: 1-185-18
* Use Code: 3200
** Store on 1st floor, with offices, apts/lofts 2nd/3
* Last evaluation (taxable value)
** Land: $50,772.00
** Improvements: $150,599.00
** Total: $201,371.00


== Info from original emails from CDP ==

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We're working on a plan to do some much needed updating for a building with great bones, big old factory-style windows, wide-open floor plan, and unbeatable location and access.  We've got up to 5,000sf (out of 10,000sf) of space remaining available and would love to find more folks like you to be part of this emerging cluster of cleantech and hardware startups.  This space is ideal for growing startups who need their own space.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Not only is this location in the midst of one of the most vibrant neighborhoods in the Bay Area, in the immediate vicinity are startups like Fathom (http://studiofathom.com/), LightSail Energy (http://www.lightsail.com/), Blue Bottle Coffee HQ (http://www.bluebottlecoffee.com/), and Public Bikes (http://publicbikes.com/).  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Incentives applicable at this location:

*The City of Oakland is offering business license and sales tax abatement as incentives
*The State of California's manufacturing equipment sale and use tax exemptions
*The State of California's California Competes income tax credit
*The State of California's New Employment Credit
*No African Americans would be displaced, only Chinese

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The base rent would be $0.90/sf NNN.  Because the upper floors of the building have been vacant for nearly 15 years we only have a rough estimate of the NNN charge as no more than $0.50/sf.  Of course the actual NNN figure would be directly calculated based on actual costs.  Our estimate is based on existing expenses and factoring in additional new expenses to maintain upgrades that will make this building suitable for hardware startups and hacker spaces: a material lift, added load on the passenger elevator, ADA access, a security system, and insurance for manufacturing-related use.  Our goal is to get the NNN cost to about $0.25/sf/month.

In addition to being able to offer you a professionally-managed, great space in a wonderful neighborhood at a price that works for you, you should know that we're actively working on plans for a hardware startup incubator/accelerator in the vicinity (maybe even elsewhere in the building) that would offer graduates of Laney's Advanced Manufacturing program a chance to develop their ideas into businesses. Another related initiative we've been nurturing is a STEM/STEAM exploration center mashup with a hardware store.

This is to say, we're much more than the typical real estate brokers, landlords, or developers. We're active community builders and doers who are passionate about the work you're doing.  And we're expert at figuring out how to make space and real estate deals work through creative and unique funding, financing and investments.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''SEE ALSO'' discussion on Sudo Room mailing list: http://lists.sudoroom.org/pipermail/sudo-discuss/2013-November/004688.html

= Pending renovations =

The floors will be redone and the freight elevator revived. If we don't care about that, then we could likely negotiate e.g. some period of free rent in exchange for not requiring those renovations. There have been some roof leakage (no mold as far as we could see) and those leaks will be fixed.

= Tax =

*Parcel number: 1-185-18

*Property tax: $4,440 secured + $4,597 supplemental = $8,997
*Assuming one floor is 1/3 of that tax: $2,999 yearly or $250 monthly

*[http://www.acgov.org/MS/prop/index.aspx?PRINT_PARCEL=1-185-18 assessment info source]
*[https://www.acgov.org/propertytax/history.htm tax history]

= Building and fire insurance =

We heard that the building/fire insurance for The Omni is only $500 a month. That seems _really_ low for such a big space. We need to get a quote, but for now let's assume $500 for one floor.

= 3rd floor = 

*Larger than 2nd floor
*Rooftop access

== Amenities ==

*Sink in main space
*Lots of natural light
*Three bathrooms
:One big enough that it could be made ADA accessible.
*Elevator
:Not ADA compliant but can possibly be grandfathered in as ADA compliant? Big enough for wheelchair to drive in and back out
*Freight elevator
:Currently not functioning, but will be put back in operation if leasers so desire.

== Costs ==

*Floor plan total: 5,425 sqft
*Floor plan total minus elevator/stairways: maybe ~5,000 sqft
*Price: 90 cents per sqft nnn.
*Creative Development Partners IG cost estimate (on top of nnn): $0.25 to $0.50 per sqft
*Our IG cost estimate: $250 tax monthly + maybe $500 building/fire insurance monthly
*Total cost estimate with CDP: $5,750 to $7,000
*Total cost estimate with ours: $5,250

= 2nd floor =

*Smaller than 3rd floor
:Acupuncturist has his office there + some space lost to shared hallway.
*Shared bathroom between acupuncturist and whoever leases the main space.
*Stair access to ground floor.
*No rooftop access.

= Rooftop =

*Accessible via stairs from 3rd floor
*Needs to be tested for structural integrity / leaks.

The CDP (leasers) will find out if the rooftop is usable. They are interested in making it a usable space. This would be an awesome space for outdoor events during the summer. Unfortunately no elevators go there and the stairs are narrow.</text>

= Intro =

The first batch was primarily made from nonpasturized apple juice with about a cup of juiced apples.

= Ingredients =

* 14 Cups of nonpasturized apple juice
* 6 Organic granny smith apples
* 2 Organic gravenstein apples

= Method =

It's a simple hard cider that should end up flat, but sweet!

1) Cleaning and sanitizing equipment: Thanks to the camden tablets this isn't super necessary, in some ways cider is much more forgiving then beer. Everything was washed but sanitizer was not used

2) Washed our apples, cored them, and chopped them into smaller chunks to fit in the blender (had to split into two batches). Poured in a cup of apple juice per blended batch, blended 'em, duh

3) Gently strained out the juice from the pulp (8 apples produced 1 cup of juice + 2 cups of store bought apple juice), combined with the remaining 12 cups of store bought juice, and poured it into the glass jug.

4) Crushed 1 camden tablet in a ziplock bag using two spoons, poured into the glass jug, plugged it with the carboy bung and waterlock (just used water to fill it, not sanitizer or vodka)

5) Waited 24 hrs before pitching Danstar ...(dang just realized I pitched WAAAAAY too much yeast *facedesk*) Windsor Ale Yeast, waited 20-30 mins and gently shook the jug

6) Covered, put in a nice cool swamp cooler, fermenting for 2 weeks (should be around 65, unfortunately has probably been averaging 68-70)

7) Racked (with slight difficulty) into another sanitized carboy to separate the cider from all the dead yeast(!) and capped. Will chill in Yardena's fridge until she gets sick of it, then maybe another 2 months in my fridge.

8) Drink! Kanpai!

= Lessons Learned =

* Don't pitch DOUBLE the amount of yeast that you're supposed to (possible fix: rack into a different container to separate out all the dead yeast, and let it rest to hopefully mellow out and lose some of the off flavors incurred by the rapid fermentation (a result of the somewhat high temp fermentation and the total overkill of yeast).

The barrier to entry to Sudo Room is intended to be very low. Sudo Room is committed to public access: the ability for the public to visit at all times that members are present, and to utilize Sudo Room's resources for community improvement (especially along the lines of [[Articles of Association|Sudo Room values]]). Sudo Room is open 24/7, but in reality is open whenever members are present (which is typically from about 9AM to 2AM).

*'''[[Inclusivity]]'''
*'''[[Getting there|Get Here]]'''

==Membership==
Sudoers are '''people who agree to the [[Articles of Association]]''' and contribute to the space through a monthly [[donation or in-kind improvement or project contribution. Members in turn '''receive the benefit of 24/7 access to Sudo Room and its [[Inventory|resources]]'''. [[Membership|Become a member]]!
==Accessibility/Disability==
La Commune Cafe and Bookstore, Rise Above Graphics, '''Sudo Room''' and Counter Culture Labs are all wheelchair-accessible on the ground floor. The ballroom is accessible via a wheelchair lift via La Commune. The doorway to the Ticket Booth Room has been widened to enable wheelchair access.

Unfortunately, we do not currently have an ADA-accessible bathroom. The bathroom connected to La Commune is currently being renovated to become a single-occupancy ADA bathroom, but we have some work to do until it's complete. The bathroom in the hallway leading to Sudo Room and Counter Culture Labs is single-occupancy and can be utilized by those with some limited mobility.

We plan to have the ADA bathroom completed by November 15th. Long-term plans include an elevator lift to the basement and upstairs areas.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3228">== Alchemy ==
Alchemy is an old art and science, practiced as a hobby, profession, life work, or magic by folks for thousands of years probably. Alchemy is based on the four elements: Earth, Air, Fire, Water. There may be a [[The Fifth Element|Fifth Element]], [[Energy]]. This is for the people at Shasta to figure out formally, but Sudo Room user [[User:EM_Che]] has proved the concept significantly. Among the processes practiced by an alchemist are mastery of the elements, balancing of the four (five) elements, distilling, levity and gravity experiments, and each may have a Master Work, which he or she is continually working on.

== Hack Alchemy ==
Alchemists live fully the reality they are experimenting with. This means not exactly literal fire, or water, but an affinity for the elements. By experimenting with the vocabulary as well as the nature of the elements, alchemists whole-heartedly and whole-mindedly can modify and alter the world around them. For alchemists, getting the desired outcome is a matter of manifestation, or the processes by which that can occur.

An alchemical transformation is to change one idea which is negative into another which fits the model. For example, decolonize or hack the idea of trash into materials. Trash manifests these materials freely, with actually a negative value for the source person or firm generally. This includes wood, metal, paper, plastic tarps and stuff e-waste such as speakers. Any construction site has these materials regularly, people who are still consumers make them, firms, and households, and dumps. In order to be sustainable, we will have to reduce the trash that Earth produces to near zero. This means that these designs (and, this process), which function well for their purpose (eg to fit our lives and solve environmental problems) will be where our Economic activity will want to be based we alternative paradigm people. Everything is free alchemy: These inventions not only allow someone to live no house, no money, but also reduce waste and can be replicated without buying them.

== Alchemy and Design ==
These four (five!) elemental inventions allow a person to live completely free - no home, no money, anywhere where there's not a fear of retaliation by the cops. It describes an alternative paradigm, and the hack-building of these items an alternative to the system.

[[File:Alchemy Hack Art Design.jpg|Alchemy Hack Art Design]]

Try it out– if you can find and design from the SudoRoom wiki, great. If you can find whatever limiting materials you need from a dumpster, and complete the rest from your workshop, that’s ideal. Clearer how-to’s which will be going into the Sudo Room wiki: http://sudoroom.org/wiki/

On Becoming an Alchemist: This book is fantastic. Teaches the magical concepts of alchemy in real life. http://books.google.com/books/about/On_Becoming_an_Alchemist.html?id=f6-5GJJRYT8C

The Alchemist: A most popular reference to Alchemy is the book by Paulo Coelho.

Alcohol at Sudo Room. This page is intended as a digital meeting room for us to converse about alcohol consumption at Sudo Room and other broader issues that come up during the exploration. What questions come to mind when thinking about alcohol consumption and safe space? Do you have any doubts, proposals, questions or proclamations? Please let us all know!  
=='''Legal implications'''==
* Is there any particular risk that Sudo Room, as an unincorporated entity, holds should there be a negative and/or police/medics-involved event related to alcohol consumption there? 
* Space Federation is working on compiling legal documents for creating policies and reporting accidents in hackerspaces. If we end up drafting some documents, we could use [https://atrium.schoolfactory.org/spacefed/node/107778 their working documents] for inspiration and extend them.
**The Ace Monster Toys wiki's &quot;[http://wiki.acemonstertoys.org/Becoming_a_Member Becoming a Member]&quot; page has potentially relevant documents, such as a ''Liability Waiver'', ''Membership Agreement'' and ''Emergency Contact Form''. [[User:Bleeblahblue|Bleeblahblue]] ([[User talk:Bleeblahblue|talk]]) 23:46, 3 February 2013 (UTC)

=='''Human implications'''==
* Should sudoers have the freedom to drink with one another to promote friendship as is customary in society?
**The general (unofficial) consensus at the Wednesday (Jan. 30th 2013) meeting was that there is no push to ban alcohol consumption in Sudo Room. [[User:Bleeblahblue|Vicky]] ([[User talk:Bleeblahblue|talk]]) 08:57, 3 February 2013 (UTC)
**If we invite students in for after-school activities, then it would be wise not to have alcohol available
* What should we do should someone inside of Sudo Room suffer from alcohol poisoning? This question should also be more broadly interpreted for other medical/psychiatric emergencies. 
**Do we have any regular members who have emergency medical/psychiatric training? [[File:vietnamese snake wine.jpg|thumb|right|'''Snake wine, anyone?''']]
***[[First_Response_Oakland|First Response Oakland]] (tentative name) is an effort to connect sudo room to information, training, and contacts for coordinating an emergency / crisis response network in Oakland.
**Where are our first aid supplies? You can find them in the upper left-hand cabinet above the sink in sudo room proper. The cabinet is marked with a red cross and the words 'First Aid Kit.' What elements are missing?

=='''Questions, etc. that don't fit the Legal-Human duality'''==
*Think about providing non-alcoholic beverages for Hacker Happy Hour!
*Brew more kombucha (doesn't ''really'' count!! Added bonus: delicious.)
**How does kombucha not really count? It is a delicious carbonated alternative to beer, wine, and liquor. [[User:Tunabananas|Tunabananas]] ([[User talk:Tunabananas|talk]]) 01:51, 22 November 2013 (PST)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3483">Anticapitalism or, the doing without money.

There are a few components which are relevant to this concept, as of yet undefined by the system. Have more of what Anticapitalism means to you? Edit this page.

First, there is a head change involved. Rather than a system that says that you need more, to be awake and free is to know that you have enough, to be happy. 
Second, In practice, to not use money means to grow a lot of your own food, or get things elsewise for free. This can include a few different methods, all of which valid. 
Third, there is a transition period. During this time the plants will not be large enough to provide most or all of your subsistence, or even if you don’t have space for plants, you can go to these community meals which are available in every city or town. Every day, people gladly make and serve food to whoever goes in the door. 
Fourth, transportation. Transportation, is always a thing. While a bike is the best option (manifest a few patches beforehand!), walking often gives a better scenery and appreciation of place. 
Fifth, land. Superman said to me behind Alameda County: &quot;Join the war, don’t pay rent!&quot; That solves that problem, any questions? Seriously, though, by being houseless and staying on native land, (like a WWOOF), now with folks I don’t pay rent. In the City right now, it's called &quot;freeloading&quot; in someone's apartment or house. This is again a transitionary thing.
Finally, the things that you have to find, or do without. Find, trade, barter, manifest, (I don’t often shoplift), grow, re-use, re-cycle, hack, redesign, etc!!!! I only cheat peanut butter and coffee. And there you have it the free life.

Wi-fi: http://www.instructables.com/id/Easy-to-Build-WIFI-24GHz-Yagi-Antenna/ Electricity alternator: http://otherpower.com/pmg2.html or better, http://www.otherpower.com/woodmill.html + [[The Fifth Element]] could be powered by a bicycle, windmill, water turbine, smoke/steam, coffee, or ideally atmospheric electricity.

Anticapitalism often includes an inherent dislike or protest of the system. If everyone opts out of using money, then that system cannot deal with it. There’s other things that lead it to not be able to deal with itself. Enough are now awake and aware that we need to take action and, watch the downfall of a system inherently unhappy and sick from the experiments consumer society. The capitalist government structure cannot survive the debt or lies of high frequency trading without our consent, itself, nor a resource consumption rate which is just not there any more.

Finally, we have anticapitalist production. This will be upcoming, in order to free the mass of humanity from the productive mandate, allowing the creation of non-competitive and non-capitalist art which serves the purposes of life and liberty. In this form, anti-capitalism becomes a revolutionary form, of how to implement such a system without either ourselves or the looters becoming greedy. We can collectively manifest the future we want to live. Materials manifest, they do. If you can manifest or find access to a tool shop, then you are free. If you buy the tools, then you’re taking back the means of production. If you’re shopping, then get in with the op-delete crowd and don’t pay back your credit card or something.

On a global scale, this translates into an effort for us to evolve past money. If you agree with the following, then we can do it: http://www.freeworldcharter.org/en/charter</text>

== About ==

The Art Making Party is a monthly event at SudoRoom. 

It occurs right as the First Friday Oakland Art Murmur ends. The theme switches out but the focus centers on the act of making art. 

There are MCs, performers, and so on but the focus isn't on them. It is on the act of creation. The musicians act more as partners with the guests, enabling them to react and make art.

= Individual Events =

== March 2014 == 

This is the second art making party.

Calendar Event:
https://sudoroom.org/ai1ec_event/art-making-party/?instance_id=

=== Schedule ===

* 6:00 - 9:00 pm - have people stand in front of SudoRoom during the Oakland art Murmur, playing music &amp; handing out flyers.
* 9:00 pm - ? - artmaking merriment begins

== Jan 2014 ==

Oakland Art Murmur - http://oaklandartmurmur.org was started by the makerspace collective http://rpscollective.com down the street.
It occurs on the first Friday of every month.

Few people know that Saturday morning/afternoon there is a Saturday Stroll (ex http://oaklandartmurmur.org/events/saturday-stroll-2013-12-07/) 
and it's actually easier to look at art and talk to the gallery owners, shop owners during this time.


== Events ==
* [[ArtMakingParty|Art Making Party]] - starting January 3, 2014 - we will have an art making party to celebrate the Year of the Snake. This will begin shortly after Art Murmur technically ends. It will not be an exhibition of art but rather one of art creation amid slideshows and a live art creation MC.


== Projects ==
* [[User:Romyilano]] is working on [[SudoSquare]], possibly with Tracey. This will be an iPhone mobile location-based app that will send passersby art pieces, videos when they are geographically close to SudoRoom. We're looking for collaborations.

== Iterating Art Murmur ==

=== Invite People to SudoRoom After the Art Murmur ===
Problems: hard to get foot traffic to SudoRoom during art murmur

* It is generally difficult to get people to go to SudoRoom during the Art Murmur, but very easy to get them to come to SudoRoom after (around 10pm) when Art Murmur shuts down. I think it's best to do an after party at SudoRoom. This tends to draw the most crowds, and people are itching to go to a community-based space to visit. It would also be a good way for newcomers to get acquainted with the space.
** Agreed! Perhaps we can pitch it as 'Art Murmur AfterHours', which is how I framed it in the pamphlet I made to hand out to folks who are visiting for the first time.

=== Saturday Stroll ===

Few people know that there is a Saturday stroll. http://oaklandartmurmur.org/events/saturday-stroll-2013-12-07/

We generally never have people here for Saturday Stroll

Sautrday Stroll is generally better for:
* people truly into art for its sake and the galleries, not just there to socialize
* children, parents
* introverted visitors

Any ideas or solutions?

== '''Monetization''' == 

If we want to sell Booze at art murmur can get a permit.
** $35 for both hard alcohol and others / day.
** 3-day authorization required.
** Must buy hard alcohol at retail.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5251">==Rocket Stove==
[[File:Rocket Stove.jpg|thumb|Rocket stove in action in Oakland. by [[User:EM_Che]]]]
The sticks burn at the end, so you feed in more as you go. Using this method I was able to bring water to a boil very quickly. A skillet, saucepan, and coffee percolator provide your camp environment. 

* Made using found materials.
* Design encourages accessibility to those without capital or experience.
* Construction skills involve bending metal and cutting metal, without welding.
* All materials are found on the street, total cost zero.
* Replicability tested. After loss, was rebuilt in a day and made at [[Noisebridge|https://www.noisebridge.net/]]

You will need:
* 1 large coffee can, paint can, or industrial-size fruit can.
* 1 regular size soup can
* small piece of metal, for the fuel shelf.
* large piece of metal, or interior can with less diameter than the outer canister.

Tools:
Necessary tools: 
* vice grips or pliers to grab and bend metal (for bending [[metal|metal experiments]]), 
* something sharp: scissors, garden shears, knife, or pliers.

Steps:

1.  Cut the bottom off of the soup can. You might use a can opener even, so long as you get the bottom off so that it is a hollow tube.

2. Cut an equal-sized hole in the bottom side of the large tin can. When busted open, this should fit the soup can inside it. [[File:Rocket Stove in Progress.jpg|thumb|Coffee can, small-size tin can: these are the basic materials for the rocket stove hack.]]

3. The fuel shelf is always the easiest for me to find. This is a narrow piece of metal which can usually be wedged into the soup can. 

4. Insert the fuel shelf into the soup can. If needed, glue this in place.

5. The inner chamber can be made with a smaller can or an untreated piece of flat metal that's as wide as the coffee can is tall, and as long as you want. This piece of metal is bent into a small circle, which lets air vent directly upwards without any interfering wavelengths. It remains to be seen if the stove could still be effective without the inner chamber division.

6. Line up paper, and rest sticks on the tray. You are ready for ignition.

7. Spark the paper and the blaze will light the sticks. Because of the air intake, the fire can burn for a long time!

Use directions: 

The Rocket Stove will burn cleanly for an extended period of time with only minimal twigs for fuel. The combustion is at the end of the sticks only, or the center of the chamber. Air enters from below the fuel intake rack, and is heated up and rises straight up to the bottom of the pot. 

If you want to cook or boil water on the rocket stove, you will need to find a grate or screen to put over the top of the stove, and the diameter of your cooking pot must be less than the diameter of the stove. A pot skirt may be added, with a wider tube, in order to also heat the side of the pot. Generally, the more sticks you put in, the hotter. Try it!

Crunch, hack... Good luck!

== A Free Bag Design ==
[[File:Noisebridge bag.jpg|thumb|Noisebridge bag]]
This &quot;Hacker Survival Kit&quot; is packed with paints, needle and thread, deodorant, hemp, markers, magic cards, coffee powder, and anything else necessary for a prolonged stay in the City or Woods. In both rural and urban areas, as well as in hiking and [[art]], repurposing fabric material in this way has made a resilient and useful sized bag. From San Francisco's own Noisebridge...













== Time as Art ==
http://lawoftime.org/images/hopi.jpg
Time is the move from the third dimension to the fourth dimension. What if we changed to a thirteen-month, 28-day calendar? This creates a perfect 13 Moons of 28 days harmonic timespace matrix. Each day is one of 20 &quot;days&quot; which repeats every three weeks. Furthermore, each day has a tone associated with it, which repeats on thirteen. Altogether, the alternative time system adds up to 364 days, with a &quot;Day Out of Time&quot; on 7/25/2014. 

If we raise our consciousnesses to this time frame, the potential for a lot of beautiful things to happen emerges. With less stress on the artificial linear construct, we can align energies and co-create. Patience and art and beauty and synchronicity come as the necessary manifestations. Time as Art allows for people to live energetically and cyclically: Time is the Frequency of Synchronicity! 

The thirteen moon galactic Synchronometer is available for free at http://lawoftime.org/freecalendar
A forum on Time as Art is available at NooSphereForum- http://NooSphereForum.org

== Sustainability as Art ==
Art of the Future builds on communal land and keeps the ship going, makes everything free and super sustainable. What is sustainable?
This is cosmic, revolutionary, future, news!

==How to Make A Free Zinebook==
[[File:How To Make a Free Zinebook.jpg|thumb|This image shows how anyone can make a free 8-page book from a single side sheet of 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; paper. The paper can have writing or anything on the back, and is completed within a minute using no necessary tools. Enjoy the artwork! Pens, markers, pencil, colored pencils, paints, or whatever works for you.]]

Materials required: 
1 (one) 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; sheet of paper, single side. This paper can be recycled if needed if it was used on one side. Eg. only one side will be needed for the design. Design also works for other sizes of paper.

Tools required:
Scissors, optional

Steps:

1. Fold the piece of paper in half horizontally, or &quot;hamburger style.&quot; Unfold the paper.

2. Fold both edges of the paper into the center crease you just made. Unfold the paper.

3. Your next fold is &quot;hotdog style,&quot; or a fold length-wise across the paper. Unfold the paper.

4. Next, tear or cut along the middle line between the first and fourth &quot;quarters.&quot; (The line &quot;4&quot; in the photo.)

5. Finally, in order to form the book you pull both middle sections out, and form your blank booklet. 


Enjoy the blank booklet! You can decorate as desired. The design is replicable and appropriate for non-hierarchical communications in your purposes. Enjoy!!!!

'''''NOTE:''' This is a historical document. For our up-to-date membership process, please visit our [[Membership]] page.''

===Section 2.0 Definition===

'''sudo room''' is a deliberative collective, meaning there is horizontal democratic control and participatory management of the organization, which is composed of all individual members. However, the group actively strives to substantially incorporate interested community participants and beneficiaries who are non-members. Members agree to decisions made by '''sudo room''' as well the terms of these Articles of Association and all future amendments.

By using spaces or services operated by '''sudo room''', community participants and beneficiaries are obligated to respect all decisions by '''sudo room''' as well as the terms of these Articles of Association and all future amendments.

===Section 2.1 Qualifications for Membership===
'''''NOTE:''' This is a historical document. For our up-to-date membership process, please visit our [[Membership]] page.''
* Membership is defined by fulfilling the following requirements:
*# Contributing monthly dues (sliding-scale with respect to operating costs) or equivalent.
*#* It is an express purpose of the group to keep membership rates low, and therefore accessible, as well as offer, when possible, alternatives to monetary contribution to suffice for monthly dues.
*# A status of good standing with the organization.
*#* Unresolved debts and/or substantial lapses in respecting the values of the organization and its members may result in suspension of membership, to be determined by fair process respecting individual rights and freedoms and the integrity of community norms.
*# Successfully completing the process for becoming a member, below:

====Section 2.1.0 Process for becoming a member====
'''''NOTE:''' This is a historical document. For our up-to-date membership process, please visit our [[Membership]] page.''
#'''Declaration of Intent to Join'''
#* To become a member, a person must submit a brief written or spoken &quot;Declaration of Intent to Join&quot; where they answer the following questions (for informational purposes only, in other words &quot;there are no wrong answers&quot;):
#** What is your (pseudo)nym and/or name?
#** Why do you want to be a member of sudo room?
#** If you know already, what are you excited to do at sudo room?
#** If you know already, what are you excited to share with the sudo room community?
#'''Initial Pondering'''
#* It is only possible to become a member at the weekly sudo room meeting. Prospective members should attend if possible but can submit a written declaration if they are not able to attend in person.
#* At the sudo room weekly meeting, every prospective member must leave the room while the existing members have a chance to bring up any concerns  or reasons why the prospective member(s) should not be allowed membership (referred to as the &quot;Initial Pondering&quot;).
#** The intent is for it to be very easy for new members to join, so only very serious concerns should be brought up.
#** If any existing member objects to a prospective new member becoming a member, and this cannot be resolved through discussion, then the  prospective member will not be allowed membership.
#** Unreasonable or frequent blocking of new members by an existing member is grounds for immediate termination of membership based on a 2/3 vote.
#*  Upon completing the &quot;Initial Pondering&quot;, such potential members must be communicated to the sudo rooom mailing list within 24 hours, including their &quot;Declaration of Intent to Join&quot;.
#'''Extended Pondering'''
#* After the Initial Pondering, if there are no objections, there will be one week for sudo room members to raise objections as to why the prospective member should not be allowed to join (referred to as the &quot;Extended Pondering&quot;).
#* If there are no objections raised during the &quot;Extended Pondering&quot;, the prospective member will become a member.
#** The intention is to provide sufficient time to ensure all concerns of those unable to attend the meeting may be heard.
#* The new member will be added to the membership list and given access to desired and relevant assets and services of sudo room.
#* No announcement of this change of status after the &quot;Extended Pondering&quot; is necessary.

===Section 3.2 Conflict Resolution===
====Sub-Section 3.2.0 Process====

[[File:SudoRoom.png|400px|right|Diagram]]
The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as '''Conflict Steward''' in the matter, and works with this '''Conflict Steward''' to find a '''Mediator'''.
## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

===Section 3.3 Corporate and Tax Status===

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At_6qzhQZBX8dHU0bWZaNkxpSkcyeG5WMVRwMVQ4aWc#gid=4 FYI, here are the fiscal solvency sheets ya'll]
====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

*dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
*For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

==Article 4. Amendments==

===Section 4.1 Process===
Amendments shall be made by:
# Announcing the proposed amendment by posting:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the '''sudo room''' ''discussion'' email  list
#* At least 1 week before the meeting at which a vote on the amendment will be held
# Recieving feedback and commentary posted:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the official '''sudo room''' anonymous etherpad: https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroom
#* On any '''sudo room''' email list.
# Adding an agenda item to an official meeting's agenda.
#* The agenda item includes time to review the feedback, receive in-person feedback, and discuss.
#*'''Decision procedure:''' Consensus

===Section 4.2 Dissolution / Termination of Association===
Dissolution must be proposed in the same manner as all other amendments to these articles. For clarity, the decision procedure will use '''consensus'''.

= Article 5. Empowerment of members =

== Section 5.1  Non-member access ==
* To empower members to deal with problematic non-members:
** Any member may deny non-members access to sudo room assets (and require the non-member in question to vacate the physical space) at any time, with no reason given, unless some other member currently present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member in question as a guest.
** Before denying a non-member access (and requiring the non-member in  question to vacate the physical space), the member must ask both the non-member and the members present in the space if any member is vouching for the non-member as a guest.
** For a non-member, being denied access (and required to vacate the physical space) is not a ban, and the non-member in question may return after 12 hours.

== Section 5.2 Domestic Use ==
The bay area is in the throes of a housing crisis. Despite the abundance of resources (space, buildings, etc), the distribution of those resources is unfair. For many it can be costly and difficult to fulfill the basic human need of shelter. However, sudo room, as a creative community and hacker space, must maintain a division between habitation and usage of the space. As such the following are resolved:
* sudo room is not intended to be used for habitation or domestic purposes.
* No-one is allowed to sleep in sudo room at any time.
* Any member can require that anyone sleeping in sudo room must leave immediately.
* Repeated sleeping at sudo room is grounds for being temporarily or permanently denied access to sudo room's assets, including its physical space.

===Section 3.2 Conflict Resolution===
====Sub-Section 3.2.0 Process====

[[File:SudoRoom.png|400px|right|Diagram]]
The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as '''Conflict Steward''' in the matter, and works with this '''Conflict Steward''' to find a '''Mediator'''.
## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

====Sub-Section 3.2.2 Maintaining Safe Space During Conflict Resolution====

In the event that a conflict stems from one or more members being threatened by another member of sudo room or a member of the wider community, a temporary ban may be placed that person until the conflict has been resolved.  Consensus in this case may be obtained at any sudo room meeting and must be ratified online over a period of 24 hours in the event quorum is not met at the meeting.  Should the person being banned fail to participate constructively in the conflict resolution process as determined by the membership, the ban shall become permanent.

===Section 3.3 Corporate and Tax Status===

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

===Section 3.4 Fiscal Solvency===
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At_6qzhQZBX8dHU0bWZaNkxpSkcyeG5WMVRwMVQ4aWc#gid=4 FYI, here are the fiscal solvency sheets ya'll]
====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

*dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
*For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

==Article 4. Amendments==

===Section 4.1 Process===
Amendments shall be made by:
# Announcing the proposed amendment by posting:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the '''sudo room''' ''discussion'' email  list
#* At least 1 week before the meeting at which a vote on the amendment will be held
# Recieving feedback and commentary posted:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the official '''sudo room''' anonymous etherpad: https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroom
#* On any '''sudo room''' email list.
# Adding an agenda item to an official meeting's agenda.
#* The agenda item includes time to review the feedback, receive in-person feedback, and discuss.
#*'''Decision procedure:''' Consensus

===Section 4.2 Dissolution / Termination of Association===
Dissolution must be proposed in the same manner as all other amendments to these articles. For clarity, the decision procedure will use '''consensus'''.</text>

==Article 3. Decision-Making==
===Section 3.0 Governance===
As a collective, '''sudo room''' members govern themselves and each retains equal rights and mutual responsibilities. 
====Sub-Section 3.0.0 Meetings====
* Meetings are held regularly, with sufficient notice for interested members to participate.
* A meeting to conduct official business of sudo room must include at least 10 members.

====Sub-Section 3.0.1 Agenda====
Agendas will be initiated with a default structure left open to addition until the beginning of the next meeting. Additions to the agenda during the meeting require a simple majority to be added, otherwise they are tabled until the next meeting.

Agenda structure:
# Announcements / Updates
#* '''Decision Procedure:''' Not applicable during meetings. 
#* Public announcements may be objected to with timely notice and the burden on the objector.
# Fiscal Solvency (Budget)
#* '''Decision Procedure:''' Automatically approve the budget formed using the procedure outlined below. All amendments to the automatic budget must be made using a consensus process. 
# Enforcement / Conflict Resolution
#* '''Decision Procedure:''' ''Fair Process'' described below.
# Proposals for Amendment
#* '''Decision Procedure:''' Follow ''&quot;Amendments&quot; Article '' below.
# Endorsements
#* '''Decision Procedure:''' By consensus.
#* Official '''sudo room''' endorsements of other events, activities, groups, or actions.

===Section 3.4 Enforcement===
====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Process====
The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as Constable in the matter, and works with this Constable to find a Mediator.
## The Mediator is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work with towards a solution.
## The Constable organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The Constable, Mediator, and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to the conflict that all conflicting parties consent to.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the Constable and Mediator agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and all relevant documentation is gathered together by the Constable and made available to the group at least one week beforehand, preferably on the wiki, and notice is broadcast to the group, preferably on the mailing list, but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of redress sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the Constable and Mediator must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the Constable and Mediator must expressly affirm that the form of redress sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' values. The request for redress must include an implementation plan approved by the Constable and the Mediator if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the Constable presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s values and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the Mediator, and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The Constable co-facilitates with the Facilitator in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, preferably but not necessarily along with implementation plans if appropriate, which are added to a list of potential remedies if neither the Constable nor the Mediator objects. They may be overruled in their objections if a second member supports the proposal.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the one under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The Constable then works with all relevant parties to implement the remedy or remedies that passed according to their implementation plans, and also to develop plans for remedies proposed during the meeting without plans if needed.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to values that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
# The accused are presumed innocent unless and until proven otherwise beyond reasonable doubt.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members is consistently maintained.
# Proportional and effective remedies should be sought.
# [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

====Sub-Section 3.6.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.6.1 Budgeting====

## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.6.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.6.3 Dues====
The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

** For a non-member, being denied access (and required to vacate the physical space) is not a ban, and the non-member in question may return after 12 hours.

====Section 2.4.1 Forgoing Habitation and Domestic Use====
The bay area is in the throes of a housing crisis. Despite the abundance of resources (space, buildings, etc), the distribution of those resources is unfair. For many it can be costly and difficult to fulfill the basic human need of shelter.

* Sudo room is not intended to be used for habitation or domestic purposes.
* No-one is allowed to sleep in sudo room at any time.
* Any member can require that anyone sleeping in sudo room must leave immediately.
* Repeated sleeping at sudo room is grounds for being temporarily or permanently denied access to sudo room's assets, including its physical space(s).

===Section 3.2 Conflict Resolution===
====Sub-Section 3.2.0 Process====

[[File:SudoRoom.png|400px|right|Diagram]]
The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as '''Conflict Steward''' in the matter, and works with this '''Conflict Steward''' to find a '''Mediator'''.
## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

===Section 3.3 Corporate and Tax Status===

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

===Section 3.4 Fiscal Solvency===

====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

*dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
*For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

==Article 4. Amendments==

===Section 4.1 Process===
Amendments shall be made by:
# Announcing the proposed amendment by posting:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the '''sudo room''' ''discussion'' email  list
#* At least 1 week before the meeting at which a vote on the amendment will be held
# Recieving feedback and commentary posted:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the official '''sudo room''' anonymous etherpad: https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroom
#* On any '''sudo room''' email list.
# Adding an agenda item to an official meeting's agenda.
#* The agenda item includes time to review the feedback, receive in-person feedback, and discuss.
#*'''Decision procedure:''' Consensus

===Section 4.2 Dissolution / Termination of Association===
Dissolution must be proposed in the same manner as all other amendments to these articles. For clarity, the decision procedure will use '''consensus'''.</text>

====Section 2.1.0 Process for becoming a member====

Sudo room's process for becoming a member strives to balance the [[#Values|values]] of openness, access, and transparency against the community's need for members to hold respect for responsibility, accountability, and safe space. The members need to trust and respect one another in order to fully self-express and to perform sudo room as a creative community and hacker space.

Sudo room respectfully request that all prospective members remember that '''trust''' is essential for our community and can be very easy to build when we all bring with us love, our genuine selves, and mutual respect.

In this regard, sudo room has replaced its formerly centralized membership process with a peer-to-peer (or peer-oriented) path to membership. '''In order to become a member of the sudo room, you must:'''

# Become aware of sudo room's history, values, culture, physical space, virtual space, and other members:
#* '''history''' - 
#* '''values''' - 
#* '''culture''' -
#* '''physical space'''
#** Come visit the space! If you can't find a good excuse, you can join for a &quot;Newbie Night&quot; at 6pm on Wednesdays before the 7pm weekly membership meeting.
#* '''virtual space'''
#** we're all over the tubes and interwebs! https://sudoroom.org/humans
#* '''members'''
#** member directory: https://sudoroom.org/humans
# Meet with at least one sudo room member to discuss becoming a member, getting feedback and help with the process.
# Sign up on this form: https://sudoroom.org/membership
# Come to a weekly sudo room meeting

The sudo room will engage in a process to reflect on your intention to join sudo room by:
# Ensuring you get a chance to communicate with at least one sudo room member about membership
# Allowing plenty of opportunities to come to the sudo room physical space, to meet other members as well as non-member participants, and to get a sense of the ongoing activities of the community.
# Provide online resources that fully detail many aspects of sudo room as possible that may help inform your decision about membership.
# Listening to other members to determine if there are any objections to your membership
#* If there are any objections, you will receive an explanation, and potentially an optional request for more information or engagement with you.

===Section 3.2 Conflict Resolution===
====Sub-Section 3.2.0 Process====

[[File:SudoRoom.png|400px|right|Diagram]]
The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as '''Conflict Steward''' in the matter, and works with this '''Conflict Steward''' to find a '''Mediator'''.
## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

===Section 3.3 Corporate and Tax Status===

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

===Section 3.4 Fiscal Solvency===
[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At_6qzhQZBX8dHU0bWZaNkxpSkcyeG5WMVRwMVQ4aWc#gid=4 FYI, here are the fiscal solvency sheets ya'll]
====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

*dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
*For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

==Article 4. Amendments==

===Section 4.1 Process===
Amendments shall be made by:
# Announcing the proposed amendment by posting:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the '''sudo room''' ''discussion'' email  list
#* At least 1 week before the meeting at which a vote on the amendment will be held
# Recieving feedback and commentary posted:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the official '''sudo room''' anonymous etherpad: https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroom
#* On any '''sudo room''' email list.
# Adding an agenda item to an official meeting's agenda.
#* The agenda item includes time to review the feedback, receive in-person feedback, and discuss.
#*'''Decision procedure:''' Consensus

===Section 4.2 Dissolution / Termination of Association===
Dissolution must be proposed in the same manner as all other amendments to these articles. For clarity, the decision procedure will use '''consensus'''.

= Article 5. Empowerment of members =

== Section 5.1  Non-member access ==
* To empower members to deal with problematic non-members:
** Any member may deny non-members access to sudo room assets (and require the non-member in question to vacate the physical space) at any time, with no reason given, unless some other member currently present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member in question as a guest.
** Before denying a non-member access (and requiring the non-member in  question to vacate the physical space), the member must ask both the non-member and the members present in the space if any member is vouching for the non-member as a guest.
** For a non-member, being denied access (and required to vacate the physical space) is not a ban, and the non-member in question may return after 12 hours.

== Section 5.2 Domestic Use ==
The bay area is in the throes of a housing crisis. Despite the abundance of resources (space, buildings, etc), the distribution of those resources is unfair. For many it can be costly and difficult to fulfill the basic human need of shelter. However, sudo room, as a creative community and hacker space, must maintain a division between habitation and usage of the space. As such the following are resolved:
* sudo room is not intended to be used for habitation or domestic purposes.
* No-one is allowed to sleep in sudo room at any time.
* Any member can require that anyone sleeping in sudo room must leave immediately.
* Repeated sleeping at sudo room is grounds for being temporarily or permanently denied access to sudo room's assets, including its physical space.

'''sudo room'''

==Article 1. Purpose==
* '''sudo room''' is an association of individuals (called &quot;sudoers&quot;) established to collectively support a [[Sudo_room|creative community and hacker space]] with [[Sudo_room/methodology|corresponding values]].

===Values===
'''sudo room''' is an open, collaborative community of creators and practitioners working toward positive social change. '''sudo room''' chooses to:
#Value open, public discourses over closed, proprietary processes.
#Value access and transparency over exclusivity.
#Value solving real problems over hypotheticals, while respecting visions of the future.
#Value community and collaboration over isolation and competition.
#Value human judgment over automation and efficiency.
#Value do-ocracy over bureaucracy.
#Value safe space over ideology.

==Article 2. Membership==

===Section 2.0 Definition===

'''sudo room''' is a deliberative collective, meaning there is horizontal democratic control and participatory management of the organization, which is composed of all individual members. However, the group actively strives to substantially incorporate interested community participants and beneficiaries who are non-members. Members agree to decisions made by '''sudo room''' as well the terms of these Articles of Association and all future amendments.

By using spaces or services operated by '''sudo room''', community participants and beneficiaries are obligated to respect all decisions by '''sudo room''' as well as the terms of these Articles of Association and all future amendments.

===Section 2.1 Qualifications for Membership===

* Membership is defined by fulfilling the following requirements:
*# Contributing monthly dues (sliding-scale with respect to operating costs) or equivalent.
*#* It is an express purpose of the group to keep membership rates low, and therefore accessible, as well as offer, when possible, alternatives to monetary contribution to suffice for monthly dues.
*# A status of good standing with the organization.
*#* Unresolved debts and/or substantial lapses in respecting the values of the organization and its members may result in suspension of membership, to be determined by fair process respecting individual rights and freedoms and the integrity of community norms.
*# Successfully completing the process for becoming a member, below:

====Section 2.1.0 Process for becoming a member====
#'''Declaration of Intent to Join'''
#* To become a member, a person must submit a brief, written or spoken &quot;Declaration of Intent to Join&quot;, where they answer the following questions (for informational purposes only, in other words &quot;there are no wrong answers&quot;):
#** What is your (pseudo)nym and/or name?
#** Why do you want to be a member of sudo room?
#** If you know already, what are you excited to do and/or learn at sudo room?
#** If you know already, what are you excited to share with and/or teach the sudo room community?
#'''Initial Pondering'''
#* It is only possible to become a member at the weekly sudo room meeting. Prospective members are encouraged to request membership in person, but can submit a written declaration, if they are not able to attend a meeting.
#* At the sudo room weekly meeting, every prospective member, as well as non-members, must leave the room, so that existing members can have a chance to discuss any concerns, or reasons why they believe the prospective member(s) should be denied membership at this time (this is referred to as the &quot;Initial Pondering&quot;).
#** The intent is for it to be easy for new members to join, so only very serious concerns should be brought up.
#** If any existing member objects (see [[#Section_2.1.1_Objections_to_Prospective_Members|Section 2.1.1]] below) to a prospective new member's request for membership, and this cannot be resolved through discussion, then the prospective member will not be allowed membership at this time.
#** Unreasonable or frequent blocking of new members by an existing member is grounds for immediate termination of membership, based on a 2/3 vote.
#*  Upon completing the &quot;Initial Pondering&quot;, potential members must be communicated to all sudo rooom members within 24 hours, including their &quot;Declaration of Intent to Join&quot;. This notice must be communicated privately to all members, and not to public email lists.
#'''Extended Pondering'''
#* After the Initial Pondering, if there are no immediate objections, there will be an additional one week pondering, to allow absent sudo room members to raise their objections (see [[#Section_2.1.1_Objections_to_Prospective_Members|Section 2.1.1]] below) as to why the prospective member should not be allowed to join at this time (this is referred to as the &quot;Extended Pondering&quot;).
#* If there are no objections (see [[#Section_2.1.1_Objections_to_Prospective_Members|Section 2.1.1]] below) raised during the &quot;Extended Pondering&quot;, the prospective member will become a member.
#** The intention is to provide sufficient time to ensure all concerns of those unable to attend the meeting may be heard.
#* The new member will be added to the membership list, and given access to desired, and relevant, assets and services, of sudo room.
#* No announcement, of this change of status, after the &quot;Extended Pondering&quot;, is necessary.

====Section 2.1.1 Objections to Prospective Members====

To clarify the process and implications of a member's objection, to a prospective member's request for membership, during either the initial pondering or extended pondering:
* Any member who raises an objection is not required to be personally identified, either directly or indirectly, with regard to the objection.
* The members present for the initial pondering, or the members notified during the extended pondering, must come to consensus on '''an explanation''', and an optional '''request''', to deliver to the prospective member in question.
** This explanation should prioritize the protection of the privacy and anonymity of any members with objections, as necessary, at the members' discretion.
** The explanation, and optional request, may provide an opportunity to resolve objections, such as to ask the prospective member to:
*** Apply again after an allotted time, in order to have a better chance to interact with the community.
*** Learn more about the sudo room community and values, such as by engaging directly with one or more particular members.
*** Write a statement to address any particular issue(s) of concern.
*** Write a statement to share what, if anything, the prospective member ''learned'' in a given situation of concern.
*** Provide some concrete evidence or proof that may settle any objections and/or clarify any misunderstandings.
*** Other reasonable requests.
* At least one current member must communicate this explanation, to the prospective member, as soon as possible.
** This current member, who communicates the explanation, should also field any relevant feedback from the prospective member, and update all current members.
* Public venues such as the weekly meeting or public email lists are '''NOT''' appropriate venues to discuss the specific details of objections to a prospective member's request to join sudo room. All conversations concerning the details of objections, concerns, explanations, requests, etc are best held privately, or among the current sudo room members, as necessary, and at the members' discretion.

### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

===Section 3.3 Corporate and Tax Status===

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

*dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
*For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

==Article 4. Amendments==

===Section 4.1 Process===
Amendments shall be made by:
# Announcing the proposed amendment by posting:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the '''sudo room''' ''discussion'' email  list
#* At least 1 week before the meeting at which a vote on the amendment will be held
# Recieving feedback and commentary posted:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the official '''sudo room''' anonymous etherpad: https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroom
#* On any '''sudo room''' email list.
# Adding an agenda item to an official meeting's agenda.
#* The agenda item includes time to review the feedback, receive in-person feedback, and discuss.
#*'''Decision procedure:''' Consensus

===Section 4.2 Dissolution / Termination of Association===
Dissolution must be proposed in the same manner as all other amendments to these articles. For clarity, the decision procedure will use '''consensus'''.

= Article 5. Empowerment of members =

== Section 5.1  Non-member access ==
* To empower members to deal with problematic non-members:
** Any member may deny non-members access to sudo room assets (and require the non-member in question to vacate the physical space) at any time, with no reason given, unless some other member currently present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member in question as a guest.
** Before denying a non-member access (and requiring the non-member in  question to vacate the physical space), the member must ask both the non-member and the members present in the space if any member is vouching for the non-member as a guest.
** For a non-member, being denied access (and required to vacate the physical space) is not a ban, and the non-member in question may return after 12 hours.

== Section 5.2 Domestic Use ==
The bay area is in the throes of a housing crisis. Despite the abundance of resources (space, buildings, etc), the distribution of those resources is unfair. For many it can be costly and difficult to fulfill the basic human need of shelter. However, sudo room, as a creative community and hacker space, must maintain a division between habitation and usage of the space. As such the following are resolved:
* sudo room is not intended to be used for habitation or domestic purposes.
* No-one is allowed to sleep in sudo room at any time.
* Any member can require that anyone sleeping in sudo room must leave immediately.
* Repeated sleeping at sudo room is grounds for being temporarily or permanently denied access to sudo room's assets, including its physical space.

## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

*dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
*For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as '''Conflict Steward''' in the matter, and works with this '''Conflict Steward''' to find a '''Mediator'''.
## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

===Section 3.3 Corporate and Tax Status===

The diversity of organizational structures shall be preserved, in order to maintain the opportunity for the most effective means of instituting incentives for creativity and innovation.

====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system

The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:

*dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
*For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

==Article 4. Amendments==

===Section 4.1 Process===
Amendments shall be made by:
# Announcing the proposed amendment by posting:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the '''sudo room''' ''discussion'' email  list
#* At least 1 week before the meeting at which a vote on the amendment will be held
# Recieving feedback and commentary posted:
#* On the official '''sudo room''' wiki.
#* On the official '''sudo room''' anonymous etherpad: https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroom
#* On any '''sudo room''' email list.
# Adding an agenda item to an official meeting's agenda.
#* The agenda item includes time to review the feedback, receive in-person feedback, and discuss.
#*'''Decision procedure:''' Consensus

===Section 4.2 Dissolution / Termination of Association===
Dissolution must be proposed in the same manner as all other amendments to these articles. For clarity, the decision procedure will use '''consensus'''.</text>

===Section 3.2 Conflict Resolution===
====Sub-Section 3.2.0 Process====

[[File:SudoRoom.png|400px|right|Diagram]]
The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as '''Conflict Steward''' in the matter, and works with this '''Conflict Steward''' to find a '''Mediator'''.
## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.
# Proportional and effective remedies.
## [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Restorative_justice Restorative] remedies are strongly preferred over [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retributive_justice retributive] remedies.

====Sub-Section 3.4.0 Assets====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
====Sub-Section 3.4.1 Budgeting====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

====Sub-Section 3.4.2 Income====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

====Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues====
The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:
* dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
** For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

====Sub-Section 3.4.4 Expenditures====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
====Sub-Section 3.4.5 Surplus====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

===Section 3.2 Conflict Resolution===
====Sub-Section 3.2.0 Process====

[[File:SudoRoom.png|400px|right|Diagram]]
The resolution of disputes and disagreements within '''sudo room''' is encouraged through informal process and the spirit of a collaborative environment. There is a process, however, by which issues that are not resolved informally and that arise within the scope of these articles of association:
# The party who seeks resolution finds someone to act as '''Conflict Steward''' in the matter, and works with this '''Conflict Steward''' to find a '''Mediator'''.
## The '''Mediator''' is an impartial and uninvolved third party who consents to assist, and with whom all conflicting parties consent to work toward a solution.
## The '''Conflict Steward''' organizes meetings for conflict resolution and maintains records of all meetings and relevant communications among the conflicting parties.
## The '''Conflict Steward''', '''Mediator''', and the conflicting parties arrange to meet to work out a resolution to which all conflicting parties consent.
# If at least one conflicting party does not consent to meet, or if at least one conflicting party is unavailable to meet in a reasonable time, all relevant circumstances considered, or if the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' agree after at least one meeting that further meetings would not be likely to lead to resolution, the issue is brought before the group in the following way:
## The issue is added to the agenda of the next official meeting scheduled at least one week in the future, and documentation is gathered by the '''Conflict Steward''' and made available to the group at least one week beforehand (on wiki), and notice is broadcast to the group (on mailing list), but information that would compromise anyone's privacy or dignity is not made public. In the description of the issue, the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is included. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must give their approval of the factual content of the documentation before it is posted. Both the '''Conflict Steward''' and '''Mediator''' must expressly affirm that the form of remedy sought by the plaintiff(s) is consistent with '''sudo room's''' [[Articles of Association#Values | values]]. The request for remedy must include an implementation plan approved by the '''Conflict Steward''' and the '''Mediator''' if it is not obvious how to implement it.
## During each meeting's agenda item on Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki are brought up for discussion followed by a vote.
### First, the '''Conflict Steward''' presents all relevant documentation about the issue.
### Then, a category of severity is established by '''consensus''' according to '''sudo room''''s [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] and the facts of the case. The category determines the voting threshold for sustaining a sanction against any party to the conflict. The categories are (in order of decreasing severity):
#### Conflict calling for membership suspension or termination.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 2/3 vote
#### Conflict where only material compensation is sought.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' 1/2 vote
#### All other conflicts.
####* '''Decision Procedure:''' Consensus
### Then, the opportunity to represent perspective is granted to each conflicting party and to the '''Mediator''', and general discussion may be held about the issue if any member wishes. The '''Conflict Steward''' co-facilitates with the '''Facilitator''' in order to answer questions specific to the conflict and provides information about the history of the conflict by referring to the documentation.
### Then, a brief period of deliberation of definite time is held, during which members are free to consider the issue or discuss it directly with others.
### Then, members may propose alternative remedies to the conflict, along with any appropriate implementation plans.
### Finally, a vote is held on the plaintiff(s)' proposed remedy, and then alternative remedies are voted upon in the order they were proposed, but only if at least one member indicates that the remedy under consideration is still relevant. After all remedies have been considered in this way, the matter is considered resolved. The '''Conflict Steward''' then ensures all relevant parties understand the remedy or remedies that passed and any corresponding implementation plans.
### Any conflicting party unsatisfied with the decision may place an appeal on the agenda in the same way that conflicts are placed on the agenda, except that a majority of the group must vote to accept the appeal during a meeting, and the process begins anew. The appeal must propose an alternative remedy and refer to [[Articles of Association#Values | values]] that were not served by the original decision.
### If at the end of any step in the process more than an hour has passed during the current meeting in considering the conflict, any member may request that a majority vote be held on whether to table the conflict until the next meeting.

====Sub-Section 3.2.1 Principles and Values Specific to Conflicts====
In the pursuit of fairness, due process in the resolution of conflicts must include: 
# Presumption of innocence.
# Right to an appeal and a fair process.
# Respect for the privacy and dignity of all members.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="859">Where there is little access to precipitation, surface water, or groundwater, we must rip water directly from the air.  Driven by the need for water at a remote facility, where construction activities have been ongoing through a years-long drought in central Texas, the development of alternative water supply technologies is underway.  Under consideration are passive radiative systems and active thermoelectric systems.


The test rig shown below only produced a few mL of water due to failure on the first evening of the commercially manufactured dehumidifier EVA-2200.  It is assumed that the fan shut off before the thermoelectric element, leading to overheating and failure.  Future systems will have to be designed with scalable power consumption and additional thermal shutdown triggers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2432">The landlord called it a &quot;crawlspace&quot; but it's actually the SudoRoom Attic. And by &quot;attic&quot;, picture a wide four-foot-tall football stadium full of death traps. Some hazards include:

* '''knob &amp; tube wiring''': Bare exposed circuits. Touch the wrong thing and get electrocuted.
* '''hot water pipes''': I burned my arm on one, in my first minute up there.
* '''rusty nails''': They poke out everywhere, at eye level. I learned to duck my head, so it only caught my hair instead of blinding me.
* '''maintenance shaft''': Four story drop with no barrier, no warning. It's one of the first things you pass by. I almost rested my phone &quot;on&quot; it
* '''thin ceiling panels''': Do not walk on these. They cannot hold your weight. Walk on the beams only. Remember the floor is 10 feet below you - or if you're above the stairwell, more like 20 feet.
* '''darkness''': Bring a flashlight, preferably a biker light that straps to your head. If you stumble, a free hand could save your life.
* '''misleading lightbulb''': right away you will see a promising light fixture - don't trust it! Its switch doesn't work. It is permanently set to &quot;on&quot;. If a lightbulb is screwed in, it will get too hot to remove easily - with no lightbulb, you have a bare circuit and another electrocution hazard. The solution? A lightbulb screwed in halfway. That's how we found it. So it shall remain.
* '''metallic dust''': It will get all over you, and in your lungs. Don't wear nice clothes!
* '''elevator''': Just don't even go NEAR this. Just don't.
* '''gas, cold water, exhaust lines''': they picked every possible place and angle to confound your movements. You'll be playing limbo and you'll get very sweaty and tired.
* '''loneliness''': You're probably up there to lay wiring from one part of the building to another (I was), so you will need help! You'll need someone to feed wire from inside SudoRoom, and possibly someone else to receive it on the other end. You can't just pull on the wire because it will get kinked and caught on &amp;#91;all of the above&amp;#93;

The plus side: in order to access this delightful crawlspace, you only need to ask our landlord to unlock a single door to a single closet - this closet is located:

* behind our common area sink/kitchen
* to the right of the women's bathroom
* if you're standing at the circuit box, it's behind your right shoulder

Climb the ladder and let the adventure begin.

= Audio Production Equipment =


== Drums ==
We have a drum kit stored in the top of the recording studio 

== Bass guitar ==
Bass guitar ready to rock in the recording studio

Guitar in the recording studio

== Microphones ==
There is a [http://bluemic.com/icicle/ Blue Icicle] '''USB microphone''' (Inventory [http://space.local/view/16 ID 16]) in the audio production closet.

FYI Some audio programs such as [http://audacity.sourceforge.net/ Audacity] require plugging in the microphone before starting the program[http://forum.audacityteam.org/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=32759].

= Amplifier and speakers =

'''You can play [[Music|music from the file server]] while inside the space'''

The amplifier and speakers were donated by Jehan. 

The amp is hooked up to the laptop on the shelf, which is the space server. Its hostname is hairball.local (using zeroconf, which should be default enabled on most gnu/linux and OS X machines, but not on windows).

The space server is running a pulseaudio server which is announced using zeroconfig. 

== Streaming audio to the space server == 

In order to stream audio from your computer to space.local, you need to have pulseaudio installed. This is default in Ubuntu. You also need some way of switching between local sound output and network sound output.

=== Command line method ===

'''warning: ''' this hasn't been tested

Open a new terminal and do:

  export PULSE_SERVER=tcp:space.local:4713

Anything you play from applications launched from that terminal should then play through the space audio server.

=== GUI method ===

Check if padevchooser is available for your system:

  apt-cache search padevchooser

If it is, then install it:

  sudo aptitude install padevchooser

If not (it's not available on newer Ubuntu systems), then you can use pasystray. You need to add this PPA:

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:christoph-gysin/pasystray
  sudo aptitude update
  sudo aptitude install pasystray

If you're using Unity (default in Ubuntu) allow systray icons from all applications (since Unity blocks them):

  gsettings set com.canonical.Unity.Panel systray-whitelist &quot;['all']&quot;

Now reload unity:
  
  unity --replace &amp; 

Start padevchooser or pasystray.

A system tray icon should appear in the top right corner. Click it and choose pulse@hairball as the default server, then as default sink, choose the option called something like &quot;pulse@hairball: Buil-in Audio Analog Stereo&quot;.

Start some program that plays audio (if the program was already running you may have to restart it after changing sinks). 

The audio should play out of the sudo room sound system speakers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2853">This is a collection of impressions from community projects and how sudo-room can learn from them, as witnessed in February 2013 by [[User:Maximilianklein|your correspondent]].

==C-Base==
C-base is disneyland in it's fit, finish, and dedication to Theming. You need to walk through the cyclindrical neon-circled (star)gates, past the mounted HQ soviet switch machinery, and into the dimly lit alien glow augmented by space sounds to really understand it. I guess you can try and look at pictures if you want a pale imitation.

I found the ring-bound archive form 1995 - the first year - and it contained the founders plan. This man (whose name unfortunately escaped my notepad) was Tolkein reincarnate. He had lore, society, language, arts, mottos all drafted impeccably. The meeting notes from the frist year were printed on custom stationary that was designed to look like a interstellar transmission.
Sudoroom needs lore, and theming. We have the creative writers, and I think that making a members only on-paper serial would be a good membership selling point as c-base did. They even had an initial member pack, that was like a dossier on your new mission at c-base. Oh by the way, the place is huge, two floors of a factory. The first is a basically more club than hackerspace, and open to the public. The underground level, which you have to walk through a model of a crashed satellite, and through a air-lock replete with sound-effects, is members only. A good monetary incentive too.

We should also create a press archive file for posterity. Its good to be able to look back. Is there a need to have this papered, or will the wiki suffice?

==Sama Cafe==
This is a cafe that is a hacker longue one day per week as part of a MTWTh cycle of art-collective/hackerspace rotation entertainment. The way the squatted Sama Cafe stays open, consensus based, and financially stable - drink sales. &quot;Club mate&quot; - which has a germanichacker history - is the staple, and sustenance of this space. We could do well to import and resell club mate as well as other drinks. (Refurbish a vending machine?)

==Wilde Renate==
This is a hackerspace at all, but a pub with a Haunted-House labrynth. An artmurmur idea for a temporary labrynth is the idea I'm trying to convey here.


==Open 3d Engineering==
A man I met gives workshops on the 3d printing. The shtick is that it's two days long, on the first you build your 3d printer, and the second you learn how to use it. So yes, it costs 800Euro to attend, but you get the printer after. (It's possible for two or more people to come away with one machine between them if they desire, reducing the cost). The paradigm shift here, is we need to stop thinking about how to sell things we make with the 3d printer, but sell the education we amassed on how to 3d print.

''Example course from SFSU: Art &amp; Biology Whether the cycles of life act as an inspiration or are actually incorporated into your art-making process, the study of biology can be a hotbed of novel visions.  In this course we will attempt to reinvent the concepts and practices of biology in an artistic context.  Possibilities may include: playing with microbes and microscopes, studying embryonic development, visiting laboratories and discussing recent advances in molecular biology.  Living art projects will be encouraged.''

==Open Source Desktop biotech lab==

Our aim is to liberate biotech from academic and commercial labs and as such we're developing the basic tool kit to allow people to do real biotech, to take a gene and add it to a bacteria colony. Our aim is to create a full tool kit that will allow everyone to innovate, these tools currently include:

# [[Open Biotech/PCR|PCR]]

# [[Open Biotech/Centrifuge|Centrifuge]]

# [[Open Biotech/Gel Box|Gel Box]]

# [[Open Biotech/Incubator (for bacterial colonies)|Incubator]]


:Throughout the course of this project, participants will co-create and foster an open access citizen science project that accomplishes specific scientific goals while educating and nurturing community and scientific creativity.
:Those participating in this project adhere to the following statements:


''We are Non-hierarchical'':

:We recognize the outcomes of hierarchy. Hierarchy represses creative thought in science, denies access to science, and holds back global scientific development. As a collective of citizen scientists working toward a more complete understanding of molecular medicine, we commit ourselves to nurturing creative, positive voices within our community. We commit ourselves to hearing everyone and refuse to acknowledge hierarchy based on: sex and gender, race, age, accreditation, education, class, or access to resources. We stand in solidarity against oppression and hierarchy.


''We believe in open access and transparency'':

:Everyone is invited to participate in and learn from this project. We will always make time for conversation and teaching opportunities. Online meetings, communications regarding this project, and all findings will be publicized on this fully-editable wiki with the stipulation that those participating adhere to a value system of '''mutual respect''', '''compassion''' and '''safety'''; while accepting that these values will be '''enforced via community-based decision making'''.


We believe in full Consensus'':

:We believe scientists should be open to discussion around research experiments, data interpretation, and project directions. To foster a spirit of openness and understanding, no decision will be made without 100% consensus.


''We believe in asking (and answering) questions'':

:'''Science is a ''quest''ion'''. Our social quest is the pursuit of knowledge. We are not approaching this project with the hope of making money. We want to collectively answer questions and serve our communities. We will stand in solidarity against anyone who chooses to co-opt or privatize any portion of this project. All knowledge must be '''free''' and '''accessible'''!

:Be Excellent to Each Other!

==Protocol==
* Plan is to only meet during official sudo room meetings, simply requiring that we have board members show up (enough for quorum).
* No need to meet separately, unless a particular circumstance requires it.
* Get things done but keep things interesting through movement, art and entertainment like meeting nude at Korean bathhouses in San Leandro

==History==
* Sudo Room has incorporated with the state of California as a Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation organized for public and charitable purposes
** Followed these instructions http://www.sos.ca.gov/business/be/filing-tips-corp.htm#artsnp
** The specific purpose of this corporation is to promote and encourage scientific, technical, engineering and artistic skills through individual projects, social collaboration, and education. In the context of these purposes, the corporation shall engage in scientific, charitable and educational activities within the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">FAQs! We can either make this its own page or use this as a working document before incorporating it (drumtap, please) into the main [[Board]] page.

Questions that still need answering:
#Why do we have a board? ''It is required in order to be incorporated''
#What responsibilities does the board have? ''Ensuring that a minimum amount of paperwork is filed per required timelines.''
#What are official positions within the board? ''The only official position is the treasurer.&lt;ref name=&quot;cc5210-5215&quot;&gt;CORPORATIONS CODE  SECTION 5210-5215 http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=corp&amp;group=05001-06000&amp;file=5210-5215&lt;/ref&gt;  Other unofficial positions may exist and should rotate; e.g. scribe, facilitator, etc&lt;ref name=&quot;articles-of-assocation&quot;&gt;Sudo Room [[Articles of Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;''
#Does the board have a chairman? ''No chairman is required.  Therefore, we don't have one.''
#Does sudoroom have a CEO? ''No CEO is required to be incorporated.  Therefore, we don't have one.  If we had one, the board would have the responsibility to hire or fire the CEO.''&lt;ref name=&quot;cc5210-5215&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
#Does a board member have a legal duty to fund raise? ''Not unless it's written in the articles of incorporation. Such a clause is not present in the sudo room Articles of Incorporation.&lt;ref&gt;Sudo Room [[Articles of Incorporation]]&lt;/ref&gt;''
#What legal and/or financial liabilities does a board member have compared to a member of sudoroom who is not on the board?
#What type of legal classification do we have? ''California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation''
#What type of legal classification do we NOT have? ''Benefit Corporation (B Corp)''
#What type of legal classification do we want to have in the future? ''501c.3''
#Are we a business? ''No''
#Do we need a business license? ''Yes''
#How does the board remain accountable to the membership? ''See the following analysis:''
##Sudo Room operates under our &quot;Articles of Association&quot;, our own unique procedures which are not barred or prevented by California Corporation's Code. A corporation is allowed to use rules or policies of its own, so long as they are lawful, etc.
##* In lieu of a direct legal source for this, here are two examples of policies from non-profit organization that are used in governance within the community and not as the primary &quot;organizational documents&quot; used to register and administer the non-profit public benefit corporation:
##**Berkeley Student Cooperative (BSC) - Policy Directory - https://www.bsc.coop/policy/index.php/Policy_Directory
##**Mozilla Foundation - Official Mozilla Policies - https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/
##In the Articles of Association Sudo Room is defined to be &quot;a deliberative collective, meaning there is horizontal democratic control and participatory management of the organization, which is composed of all individual members.&quot; - https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association#Section_2.0_Definition
##Day-to-day decision making is algorithmic and depends on a consensus process for most situations, and exceptions for fringe-cases https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association#Article_3._Decision-Making
##We needed to create a Board of Directors to create a proper state public benefit non-profit corporation and qualify to apply for federal 501(c)3 tax exempt status, given that sudo room's existence and mission are clearly for public benefit. You can see the Board's tasks include ensuring we fulfill the minimal responsibilities imposed on us by the state, and not other things: https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Board#Tasks The purview of the Board is responsibility, and not to meddle in day-to-day affairs which is managed by the lower-level policy (Articles of Association).
##If a member of the Board starts irresponsibly wielding power, which they may be technically capable of doing, the general members should remove this Board member from the board (this only needs a majority of members, though we would strive for consensus): https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Bylaws#c._Removal_of_Directors
#*In this way, there is an accountability mechanism that provides an exit-strategy and discourages transgression of Board members against the community's will and needs.

hackvana has an IRC channel on freenode, #hackvana where you can talk with others for advice, including Mitch Davis who runs the company, and ask about your order.  Jerkey has used them with satisfaction.  They are friendly with KiCAD, the best FOSS circuit CAD project. They prefer Paypal, or someone in Australia who can pay in person.

*[http://www.elecrow.com/ Elecrow]

Jerkey used Elecrow once and they fucked up the order, sent boards of the wrong thickness, and at least 2 out of 15 boards were defective.  If this weren't enough, they have a &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; website and they can't decide which one you should use, neither site uses TLS, and they're both horrible, and they reject your credit card even if it's fine.  Then send emails saying your order is on its way, even though it's been rejected, and weeks later you ask WTF and they're like &quot;oops&quot;

Jerkey says DON'T USE ELECROW.

Rab ordered [https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-manufacturing.html 10pcs- 2 layer PCB] seven times over 2015 to 2018. Each order was satisfactory. No extra charge for typical silkscreen colors. Faint marks on the pads indicate 100% e-test. No manufacturer's mark placed on either side. 1-4 extra copies were included with each order, possibly to offset any failures. No electrical failures. Some PCBs exhibited: light scratches in solder mask; minor inconsistencies in board outline milling; silkscreen faded or smudged. With Shenzhen DHL shipping (~$20 extra), 7 calendar day turnaround from order placed to received. HOWEVER: one order was shipped via Registered Airmail rather than DHL as requested, resulting in total turnaround of 3 weeks. When contacted, Elecrow apologized and immediately refunded the difference in shipping charges. New website is operational and works fine.

Rab recommends careful review of order confirmation email. Also, Chinese New Year delaying February orders is a real phenomenon.

Rab abused their job preview function and noticed that it doesn't appear to display tented vias properly. (Renders as untented). Better check your gerbers with [http://gerbv.geda-project.org/ gerbv]. Two of two orders placed had faster turnaround than expected. Good quality, a cheap option for tiny boards.

You work with a million-dollar truck that's also a one-of-a-kind scientific instrument. Every noteworthy function on this truck passes through a single PCB full of relays and optocouplers in an inaccessible location. Thanks to a PCB design flaw, the board fails in the middle of a three-million-dollar project on another continent. The spare board is also faulty. The manufacturer only made two boards.

After performing the field repair of your career and returning home victorious, you volunteer to reverse-engineer and create a clone of this goddamn board. One so much better designed and more reliable that it never fails again. Your reputation is on the line. Money is no object. And you need the PCBs in 72 hours. Where do you turn?

I used Gold Phoenix for the [https://github.com/AustinHackers/ahabadge AHA! badge] v1, seems to be on the expensive side but they did good work. I didn't provide them with a pick-n-place file, they figured it out from the gerbers.
They sent me a query about it because my footprint for my buttons had 5 pads but the buttons only had 4 legs.
They edited my silk screen for the better, I had a label that collided with a diode and they moved it.
They sent me 5 assembled boards to verify before they made the rest.
They also gave me some resistors for free because I had the wrong quantity on my BOM.
They pointed out the error and I was like &quot;plz populate both those resistors, quote me for the extra parts&quot; and they were all &quot;don't worry about it,&quot; of course it was only like $0.14 worth of extra parts.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=='''HELP!  how do i stop it printing stuff nobody wants?'''==
if you're printing from linux, try emptying your local print spool by typing &lt;code&gt;lprm&lt;/code&gt;

also try the printer's web interface maybe

==bare-metal linux instructions==

#** &lt;code&gt;systemctl start cups&lt;/code&gt;
# You configure CUPS through the browser at: http://localhost:631/admin

== Getting More Toner ==

Bring the empty toner cartridge to [http://www.yelp.com/biz/cartridge-world-oakland Cartridge World] and they will give you a full one for $50ish. They reuse the cartridges. They've always had plenty of this model in stock. If you know of a cheaper alternative please edit this wiki.

It's just down the road, 1.5 miles away. [https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Sudo+Room/Cartridge+World+Rockridge Directions]

Make sure you bring just the cartridge and not the entire drum thing. Those are more expensive and breakable.

== Duplex Mode ==

Duplex mode is when it prints on both sides of the page. You can turn this on/off at the web interface: http://192.168.42.12/user/prnset.html

In duplex mode, I advise printing just one copy at a time. If you try to print multiple copies in one job, it might collate them wrong. This just happened to me. I tried to print two copies, but each sheet had the same exact thing front &amp; back. Very weird.

== Network Fail ==

Sometimes the network settings get fucked up because someone factory reset it or something. You can print the current settings by pressing '''Go''' 3 times within 2 seconds. If it got factory reset, the IP address will probably be &lt;code&gt;169.254.32.12&lt;/code&gt; so you can fix it by connecting your linux laptop directly by ethernet and then something like:

 sudo ip link set eth0 up
 sudo ip addr add 169.254.32.11/16 broadcast 169.254.32.255 dev eth0

Then visit the [http://169.254.32.12/printer/main.html settings page] in your browser. The default auth is:

 Username: admin
 Password: access

=== Fixing the settings ===

Tell wifi to use sudomesh:
* http://169.254.32.12/bio/wlan.html
** Wireless Network Name (SSID): sudomesh

Then change the wifi TCP/IP settings:
* http://169.254.32.12/bio/tcpip2002.html?interface=2
** IP Address: 192.168.42.12
** Gateway: 192.168.42.1

Then make it use the wifi instead of ethernet:
* http://169.254.32.12/bio/multiif.html
** Auto Switching ( Enable Both Interfaces )

The printer will restart and the page won't reload. But now wifi should work. For some reason you can't have wifi + ethernet at the same time.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">''At the first Omni Delegates meeting we all decided to write up a &quot;vision&quot; to share for this new collective. This is a draft-in-progress representing Sudoroom's vision for the collective of collectives.''

== THE BUILDING BLOC ==

The ''Building Bloc'' is a new group committing to serve our wider communities by solving the legal, logistical and economic problems related to holding physical spaces for the greater good. We are a 'meta-collective' or a 'collective of collectives'. Each of us represents a larger collective group in need of physical space. We are welcoming and encouraging new groups to join us.

=== What kind of groups? Mainly: ===
* Non-profit
* Volunteer-led
* Donation-based
* Offer value to the public for free or sliding scale
* So far: a school, a hackerspace, activists, artists

=== What core values do groups share? ===
* social, economic &amp; environmental justice
* solidarity with all oppressed people
* a culture of consent, against rape, violence &amp; exploitation
* the survival &amp; thrival of our communities and neighborhoods

=== What do we use our physical space for? ===
* To collaborate on projects
* To host classes and performances
* To network, meet each other, welcome newcomers
* To store resources for common use (or equitably restricted)

=== Meeting structure: ===
* We try to be as democratic and transparent as possible
* At the same time, we want to efficiently get real work done
* Meetings are open, but please respect that we have a lot of work to do and limited time! Please don't contribute to burnout by concern-trolling, flame-baiting, or talking a whole lot about nothing! :)

=== Things we haven't figured out yet: ===
* How to distribute resources? When/how are groups allowed to restrict access to outsiders? Should we set a minimum baseline of public accessibility, or of offering free/sliding-scale value to the public?
* Process for onboarding new groups: Accepting new groups could be overwhelming, or even an attack vector for people wanting to steal, subvert or derail our mission.
* How to distribute power? One group, one vote? Participatory budgeting? IMHO we should incorporate in such a way as to make it impossible to subvert the mission - create a legal firewall that protects the core mission and even the money from everybody including ourselves. Think: land trusts
* How to have an open, transparent process while also handling private, vulnerable, sensitive and personal information?
* Some compromise with capitalism is probably necessary, but how much? Selling drinks? Selling fridge magnets? Selling access to a spa? How do we decide this?
* Make sure &quot;non-profit&quot; can include worker-coops where people get paid for their labor, and where surplus can be reinvested in the business, without nitpicky dogmatic definitions of the word &quot;profit&quot;</text>

Below are questions they've passed along to sudo - feel free to answer them!:

Questions for SudoRoom.org

Commons film – December 2013

==Sudo Room Request==
We are currently awaiting the director's response to our request that any footage of sudo room/sudoers be made CC, CC-BY, or CC-BY-SA.

==Documentary Response==
All video filmed of Sudo Room will be [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gs5yobur2898m85/Gu9tpyAVJA online] for pending review of members.  If any content is questionable for use in the documentary please contact Bunker.

I currently am looking at: &quot;Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0)&quot; licensing

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en_US - human-readable plain summary

http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/legalcode - license

Here are our concerns:
# As long as we can distribute the film, Creative Commons licensing looks appropriate. 
# Most important: Many people appear in the film, so our treatment of them is a huge concern for me. With CC licensing can we be sure that they are treated with great respect, if we share this widely and allow others rights to create derivative material? 
# For example, what if a political satirist mocks somebody using our material?
# Making money is less important, but is still very helpful. It would be nice to have a license that allowed us to represent that we own the film.

=Questions=

==Online freedoms==

1. What is currently happening to free expression online?

2. Who is reducing online free expression?

3. How do they do that?

4. Who is affected by reducing online freedoms? What users, in what ways?

5. Do you have a graphic or visual way of depicting NSA/Government Surveillance?

==Walk-through of the points where surveillance could happen==

6. Can you walk us through surveillance, starting from outside wiring, through connections, to a computer, how people might be under surveillance? Wires/fibre, cell towers, connection boxes, WiFi router signals, modems, computers, phones, visually showing them... (NOTE: If possible, try to show points along the fibre/wire transmission starting from connections outside a building, walking us through to an inside computer...).

==SudoRoom.org==
1. Please tell us about SudoRoom.org.

2. Why do you personally find it important to support SudoRoom?

3. What drives your personal interest in action?

4. Why was SudoRoom needed?

5. Who participates in SudoRoom – physically? Online?

6. Why do they help?

7. What does SUDO mean? What does it represent as a name for the organization?

==SudoRoom projects==
Please show it only if it can be publicly depicted:

1. Please walk us through a few SudoRoom projects – if they can be shown in a public film. (NOTE: please try show as much visually as possible so those outside the IT community can understand it).

2. Can you show the physical making of the devices that SudoRoom makes, keeping in mind that this is a public film?

==Commons and SudoRoom’s work==

16. Successful Commoners often have a core service they provide to support themselves. What does/could SudoRoom provide?

==Request==

17. What would you ask of others watching this film, who may be considering taking action to help the situation in their own ways?

=Original Invitation/Request=
Hello Sudo Room,

My name is Bunker and I'm part of a documentary team from the east coast
making a film about the 'Commons'.  We're interested in filming your
organization over the next few weeks and wanted to know a good way to get
in touch with you.

My information is below and you can get in touch with me anytime.

The film is about reintroducing the idea of the commons to the general
public, the idea that communities should be in charge of their resources.
 It's a film that shows how privatization of people's needs has lead to
many of the major problems we face today in the United States.  Throughout
the past 5 year's we've filmed all over the United States talking to
experts on the commons, showing how the commons have been taken away from
us and also showing people who are bringing them back.

We believe that Sudo Room is a great example of brining back the digital
commons to the local community of Oakland.  It's a fantastic thing you're
doing and we're really excited to have the opportunity to see your space
and interview some of your members.

Most of all we want to film during times of action.  Any events and
projects that we can film that are coming up would be great.

Thanks a lot, hope to hear from you soon,
-bunker

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5296">The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas Business Model Canvas] is a way to think through how you 
* turn your idea into an activity that can sustain itself and 
* communicate its &quot;business model&quot; quickly, briefly, and simply. 
Nine building blocks of the business model tell your story: Partners deliver Resources through Activities so you can transform them by creating Value. This affects your Cost Structure. Each Customer Segment receives value through Channels and builds a Relationship. This shapes your Revenue Streams. The canvas lets you flesh out each part and see how they relate to each other. 

http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Business_Model_Canvas.png/800px-Business_Model_Canvas.png

==How to use the Business Model Canvas==
# Draw the 9 blocks on a white board or big piece of paper. 
# Put post-it notes, placeholder language, and quick sketches in each block
# Visualize how the blocks interact and adjust your model
# Take snapshots before and after major changes
# Color code post-its or markers to a particular customer segment 

==The Building Blocks To Imagine==
===Revenue Streams===

BYLAWS OF SUDO ROOM

= Things we may want to change =

== Throughout ==

=== 501(c) References ===

In order to provide maximum flexibility in federal tax structure, should change references to 501(c)(3) below. Certainly these articles are to be formed ASAP in order to avoid hindering progress in collaboration with other entities like Counter Culture Labs and The Public School. However, it is not an immediate requirement to resolve federal tax status to do that (though it should be done soon). So, with a few minor adjustments, it is possible to ensure we may potentially incorporate as a 501(c)(4), 501(c)(8), 501(c)(10), or other. There are a few ways to do this. 

Options:

* One approach is to list all applicable options
** Example: http://caminowoodsii.org/documents/articles.html
* Another is to ensure references to 501(c)(3) are augmented to be relevant to 501(c) statuses in general.
** Seems like this is possible since the language used for our particular purposes are general enough to fit within all of the relevant statuses anyhow, so I think we run little risk.
* Eliminate specific references to 501(c) statues entirely, but keep the appropriate components that would be applicable in particular. 
** Counter Culture Labs has largely done this with only two actual references to 501(c)(3).

== Article 3 ==

This is about our purpose and values. We can and should more or less freely change 3.1 and 3.2, but 3.3 should remain unchanged.

== Article 6.1 ==

== Article 12 ==

Insurance. This sections says that &quot;This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law&quot;. Maybe we want to drop the &quot;and shall use its best efforts&quot; part?

Such matters include amendments of the articles of incorporation or bylaws changing proxy rights; certain other amendments of the articles of incorporation; removal of directors without cause; filling vacancies on the board of directors; the sale,
lease, exchange, conveyance, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all corporate assets, unless the transaction is in the usual and regular course of the corporation's activities; the principal terms of a merger or the amendment of a merger agreement; or the election to dissolve the corporation.

:(a) it is revoked by the member executing it, before the vote is cast under that proxy
::(i) by a writing delivered to the corporation stating that the proxy is revoked, or
::(ii) by a subsequent proxy executed by that member and presented to the meeting, or
::(iii) as to any meeting, by that member's personal attendance and voting at the meeting; or

No meeting may be adjourned for more than 45 days. When a members' meeting is adjourned to another time or place, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place to which the meeting is adjourned (or the means of electronic transmission by and to the corporation or electronic video screen communication, if any, by which members may participate) are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken. If after adjournment a new record date is fixed for notice or voting, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each

If established, the audit committee shall perform the duties and adhere to the guidelines set forth in the corporation's audit committee charter as amended from time to time by the board. Such duties include, but are not limited to:

Pursuant to Section 7.10.a. of these bylaws, the board may appoint two or more directors of the corporation to serve as the executive committee of the board. The executive committee, unless limited by a resolution of the board, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the board in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation between meetings of the board; provided, however, that the executive committee shall not have the authority of the board in reference to those matters enumerated in Section 7.10.a. All actions of the executive committee shall be reported to and ratified by the full board at the next duly scheduled board meeting.
===e. Investment Committee===
This corporation may have an investment committee comprised of no fewer than three directors. If established, the committee shall act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims to accomplish the purposes of the institution. Any individual investments shall be considered as part of an overall investment strategy. Such a committee shall consider present and future financial requirements, expected total return, general economic conditions, the appropriate level of risk, appropriate levels of income, growth and long-term net appreciation, and the probable safety of the funds. The committee may retain professional money managers, and shall develop an investment policy that shall be reconsidered at feast annually, in light of the changing needs of the corporation, economic conditions, and any other factors that may affect the corporation's tolerance of risk and need for income. The committee may recommend the retention of property contributed by a donor (whether or not it produces income), and a donor's request should be a factor in making the determination of whether to sell a particular asset contributed by a donor.

===f. Meetings and Action of Committees===
Meetings and actions of committees of the board shall be governed by, held, and taken under the provisions of these bylaws concerning meetings and other board actions, except that the time for general meetings of such committees and the calling of special meetings of such committees may be set either by board resolution or, if none, by resolution of the committee. Minutes of each meeting shall be kept and shall be filed with the corporate records. The board may adopt rules for the governance of any committee as long as the rules are consistent with these bylaws. If the board has not adopted rules, the committee may do so.

=Article 9. Contracts With Directors=
No director of this corporation nor any other corporation, firm, association, or other entity in which one or more of this corporation's directors are directors or have a material financial interest, shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction with this corporation, unless (a) the material facts regarding that director's financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership, or financial interest are fully disclosed in good faith and noted in the minutes, or are known to all members of the board prior to the board's consideration of such contract or transaction; (b) such contract or transaction is authorized in good faith by a majority of the board by a vote sufficient for that purpose without counting the votes of the interested directors; (c) before authorizing or approving the transaction, the board considers and in good faith decides after reasonable investigation that the corporation could not obtain a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort under the circumstances; and (d) the corporation for its own benefit enters into the transaction, which is fair and reasonable to the corporation at the time the transaction is entered into.

This Section does not apply to a transaction that is part of an educational or charitable program of this corporation if it (a) is approved or authorized by the corporation in good faith and without unjustified favoritism and (b) results in a benefit to one or more directors or their families because they are in the class of persons intended to be benefited by the educational or charitable program of this corporation,
=Article 10. Loans to Directors and Officers=
This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer without the approval of the California Attorney General, provided, however, that the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of his or her duties if that director or officer would be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses by the corporation.
=Article 11. Indemnification=
To the fullest extent permitted by law, this corporation shall indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and other persons described in Corporations Code section 5238(a), including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any &quot;proceeding,&quot; as that term is used in that section, and including an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person described in that section. &quot;Expenses,&quot; as used in this bylaw, shall have the same meaning as in that section of the Corporations Code.
On written request to the board by any person seeking indemnification under Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) the board shall promptly decide under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) has been met and, if so, the board shall authorize indemnification. If the board cannot authorize indemnification, because the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not parties to that proceeding, the board shall promptly call a meeting of members. At that meeting, the members shall determine under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the members present at the meeting in person or by proxy shall authorize indemnification.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise determined by the board in a specific instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under Article 11 of these bylaws in defending any proceeding covered by that Section shall be advanced by the corporation before final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person that the advance will be repaid unless it is ultimately found that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for those expenses.
=Article 12. Insurance=
This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law on behalf of its officers, directors, employees, and other agents, to cover any liability asserted against or incurred by any officer, director, employee, or agent in such capacity or arising from the officer's, director's, employee's, or agent's status as such.

===a. Membership Records===
Unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative as provided below, any member may do either or both of the following for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member:
* (1) Inspect and copy the records containing members' names, addresses, and voting rights during usual business hours on five days' prior written demand on the corporation, which must state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
* (2) Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, on written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of names, addresses, and voting rights of members who are entitled to vote for directors as of the most recent record date for which that list has been compiled, or as of the date, after the date of demand, specified by the member. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The secretary shall make this list available to the member on or before the later of ten days after the demand is received or the date specified in the demand as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.

The corporation may, within ten business days after receiving a demand under this Section, make a written offer of an alternative method of reasonable and timely achievement of the proper purpose specified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. Any rejection of this offer must be in writing and must state the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.

If the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for a purpose other than one reasonably related to a person's interest as a member, or if it provides a reasonable alternative under this Section, it may deny the member access to the membership list. Any inspection and copying under this Section may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.
===b. Accounting Records and Minutes===
On written demand on the corporation, any member may inspect, copy, and make extracts of the accounting books and records and the minutes of the proceedings of the members, the board of directors, and committees of the board at any reasonable time for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member. Any such inspection and copying may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.
===c. Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws===
This corporation shall keep at its principal California office the original or a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date, which shall be open to inspection by the members at all reasonable times during office hours. If the corporation has no business office in California, the secretary shall, on the written request of any member, furnish to that member a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date.
==14.2. Directors' Right to Inspect==
Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect the corporation's books, records, documents of every kind, physical properties, and the records of each subsidiary. The inspection may be made in person or by the director's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts of documents,
=Article 15. Required Reports=
==15.1. Annual Report==
The board shall cause an annual report to be sent to the members and directors within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year. That report shall contain the following information, in appropriate detail:

:(c) The corporation's revenue or receipts, both unrestricted and restricted to particular purposes;

This requirement of an annual report shall not apply if the corporation receives less than $25,000 in gross receipts during the fiscal year, provided, however, that the information specified above for inclusion in an annual report must be furnished annually to all directors and to any member who requests it in writing. If the board approves, the corporation may send the report and any accompanying material sent pursuant to this section by electronic transmission.
==15.2. Annual Statement of Certain Transactions and Indemnifications==
As part of the annual report to all members, or as a separate document if no annual report is issued, the corporation shall, within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year, annually prepare and mail, deliver, or send by electronic transmission to each member and furnish to each director a statement of any transaction or indemnification of the following kind:
:(a) Any transaction
::(i) in which the corporation, or its parent or subsidiary, was a party,
::(ii) in which an &quot;interested person&quot; had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and
::(iii) which involved more than $50,000 or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000. For this purpose, an &quot;interested person&quot; is either
:::(1) any director or officer of the corporation, its parent or subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or
:::(2) any holder of more than 10 percent of the voting power of the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary. The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to the corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.
:(b) Any indemnifications or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation under Article 11 of these bylaws, unless that indemnification has already been approved by the members under Corporations Code section 5238(e)(2).

BYLAWS OF SUDO ROOM

= Things we may want to change =

== Throughout ==

=== 501(c) References ===

In order to provide maximum flexibility in federal tax structure, should change references to 501(c)(3) below. Certainly these articles are to be formed ASAP in order to avoid hindering progress in collaboration with other entities like Counter Culture Labs and The Public School. However, it is not an immediate requirement to resolve federal tax status to do that (though it should be done soon). So, with a few minor adjustments, it is possible to ensure we may potentially incorporate as a 501(c)(4), 501(c)(8), 501(c)(10), or other. There are a few ways to do this. 

Options:

* One approach is to list all applicable options
** Example: http://caminowoodsii.org/documents/articles.html
* Another is to ensure references to 501(c)(3) are augmented to be relevant to 501(c) statuses in general.
** Seems like this is possible since the language used for our particular purposes are general enough to fit within all of the relevant statuses anyhow, so I think we run little risk.
* Eliminate specific references to 501(c) statues entirely, but keep the appropriate components that would be applicable in particular. 
** Counter Culture Labs has largely done this with only two actual references to 501(c)(3).

== Article 3 ==

This is about our purpose and values. We can and should more or less freely change 3.1 and 3.2, but 3.3 should remain unchanged.

== Article 6.1 ==

A member is proposed for membership by one existing member. Do we want to change this to two?

== Article 12 ==

Insurance. This sections says that &quot;This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law&quot;. Maybe we want to drop the &quot;and shall use its best efforts&quot; part?

Such action by written consent shall have the same force and effect as any other validly approved action of the board. All such consents shall be filed with the minutes of the proceedings of the board.

Directors may receive such compensation, if any, for their services as directors or officers, and such reimbursement of expenses, as the board may establish by resolution to be just and reasonable as to the corporation at the time that the resolution is adopted.

The board may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of any such committee, who may replace any absent member at any meeting. Any such committee shall have all the authority of the board, to the extent provided in the board resolution, except that no committee may do the following:

===b. Audit Committee===
The corporation may have an audit committee consisting of at least two directors, and may include nonvoting advisors. Directors who are employees or officers of the corporation or who receive, directly or indirectly, any consulting, advisory, or other compensatory fees from the corporation (other than for service as director) may not serve on the audit committee. If established, the audit committee shall perform the duties and adhere to the guidelines set forth in the corporation's audit committee charter as amended from time to time by the board. Such duties include, but are not limited to:
:(a) Assisting the board in choosing an independent auditor and recommending termination of the auditor, if necessary;
:(b) Negotiating the auditor's compensation;
:(c) Conferring with the auditor regarding the corporation's financial affairs; and

Pursuant to Government Code section 12586(g) and the applicable provisions of federal law, if established, the compensation committee shall review the compensation of the president, chief financial officer, and such other officers of the corporation the compensation committee determines appropriate, annually and whenever a modification in compensation is proposed. Such a review shall include an evaluation of the performance of the officers and an analysis of appropriate comparability data. Based on its review (and existence), the compensation committee shall recommend just and reasonable compensation amounts for the officers to the board. At the request of the president or the board, the compensation committee shall review any issue involving staff compensation and benefits, including but not limited to housing, health, and retirement plans.

===d. Executive Committee===
Pursuant to Section 7.10.a. of these bylaws, the board may appoint two or more directors of the corporation to serve as the executive committee of the board. The executive committee, unless limited by a resolution of the board, shall have and may exercise all the authority of the board in the management of the business and affairs of the corporation between meetings of the board; provided, however, that the executive committee shall not have the authority of the board in reference to those matters enumerated in Section 7.10.a. All actions of the executive committee shall be reported to and ratified by the full board at the next duly scheduled board meeting.
===e. Investment Committee===
This corporation may have an investment committee comprised of no fewer than three directors. If established, the committee shall act with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity and familiar with these matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of like character and with like aims to accomplish the purposes of the institution. Any individual investments shall be considered as part of an overall investment strategy. Such a committee shall consider present and future financial requirements, expected total return, general economic conditions, the appropriate level of risk, appropriate levels of income, growth and long-term net appreciation, and the probable safety of the funds. The committee may retain professional money managers, and shall develop an investment policy that shall be reconsidered at feast annually, in light of the changing needs of the corporation, economic conditions, and any other factors that may affect the corporation's tolerance of risk and need for income. The committee may recommend the retention of property contributed by a donor (whether or not it produces income), and a donor's request should be a factor in making the determination of whether to sell a particular asset contributed by a donor.

===f. Meetings and Action of Committees===
Meetings and actions of committees of the board shall be governed by, held, and taken under the provisions of these bylaws concerning meetings and other board actions, except that the time for general meetings of such committees and the calling of special meetings of such committees may be set either by board resolution or, if none, by resolution of the committee. Minutes of each meeting shall be kept and shall be filed with the corporate records. The board may adopt rules for the governance of any committee as long as the rules are consistent with these bylaws. If the board has not adopted rules, the committee may do so.

=Article 8. Officers of the Corporation=
==8.1. Offices Held==
The officers of this corporation shall be a president, a secretary, and a chief financial officer. The corporation, at the board's discretion, may also have a chairman of the board, one or more vice presidents, one or more assistant secretaries, one or more assistant treasurers, and such other officers as may be appointed under Section 8.3 of these bylaws.

===c. Vice Presidents===
If the president is absent or disabled, the vice presidents, if any, in order of their rank as fixed by the board, or, if not ranked, a vice president designated by the board, shall perform all duties of the president. When so acting, a vice president shall have all powers of and be subject to all restrictions on the president. The vice presidents shall have such other powers and perform such other duties as the board or the bylaws may require.

=Article 9. Contracts With Directors=
No director of this corporation nor any other corporation, firm, association, or other entity in which one or more of this corporation's directors are directors or have a material financial interest, shall be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract or transaction with this corporation, unless (a) the material facts regarding that director's financial interest in such contract or transaction or regarding such common directorship, officership, or financial interest are fully disclosed in good faith and noted in the minutes, or are known to all members of the board prior to the board's consideration of such contract or transaction; (b) such contract or transaction is authorized in good faith by a majority of the board by a vote sufficient for that purpose without counting the votes of the interested directors; (c) before authorizing or approving the transaction, the board considers and in good faith decides after reasonable investigation that the corporation could not obtain a more advantageous arrangement with reasonable effort under the circumstances; and (d) the corporation for its own benefit enters into the transaction, which is fair and reasonable to the corporation at the time the transaction is entered into.

This Section does not apply to a transaction that is part of an educational or charitable program of this corporation if it (a) is approved or authorized by the corporation in good faith and without unjustified favoritism and (b) results in a benefit to one or more directors or their families because they are in the class of persons intended to be benefited by the educational or charitable program of this corporation,
=Article 10. Loans to Directors and Officers=
This corporation shall not lend any money or property to or guarantee the obligation of any director or officer without the approval of the California Attorney General, provided, however, that the corporation may advance money to a director or officer of the corporation for expenses reasonably anticipated to be incurred in the performance of his or her duties if that director or officer would be entitled to reimbursement for such expenses by the corporation.
=Article 11. Indemnification=
To the fullest extent permitted by law, this corporation shall indemnify its directors, officers, employees, and other persons described in Corporations Code section 5238(a), including persons formerly occupying any such positions, against all expenses, judgments, fines, settlements, and other amounts actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection with any &quot;proceeding,&quot; as that term is used in that section, and including an action by or in the right of the corporation, by reason of the fact that the person is or was a person described in that section. &quot;Expenses,&quot; as used in this bylaw, shall have the same meaning as in that section of the Corporations Code.
On written request to the board by any person seeking indemnification under Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) the board shall promptly decide under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Corporations Code section 5238(b) or section 5238(c) has been met and, if so, the board shall authorize indemnification. If the board cannot authorize indemnification, because the number of directors who are parties to the proceeding with respect to which indemnification is sought prevents the formation of a quorum of directors who are not parties to that proceeding, the board shall promptly call a meeting of members. At that meeting, the members shall determine under Corporations Code section 5238(e) whether the applicable standard of conduct has been met and, if so, the members present at the meeting in person or by proxy shall authorize indemnification.

To the fullest extent permitted by law and except as otherwise determined by the board in a specific instance, expenses incurred by a person seeking indemnification under Article 11 of these bylaws in defending any proceeding covered by that Section shall be advanced by the corporation before final disposition of the proceeding, on receipt by the corporation of an undertaking by or on behalf of that person that the advance will be repaid unless it is ultimately found that the person is entitled to be indemnified by the corporation for those expenses.
=Article 12. Insurance=
This corporation shall have the right, and shall use its best efforts, to purchase and maintain insurance to the full extent permitted by law on behalf of its officers, directors, employees, and other agents, to cover any liability asserted against or incurred by any officer, director, employee, or agent in such capacity or arising from the officer's, director's, employee's, or agent's status as such.
=Article 13. Maintenance of Corporate Records=
This corporation shall keep the following:
:(a) Adequate and correct books and records of account;
:(b) Minutes of the proceedings of its members, board, and committees of the board; and
:(c) A record of each member's name, address, and class of membership.
The minutes and other books and records shall be kept either in written form or in any other form capable of being converted into clearly legible tangible form or in any combination of the two.

=Article 14. Inspection Rights=
==14.1. Members' Right to Inspect==
===a. Membership Records===
Unless the corporation provides a reasonable alternative as provided below, any member may do either or both of the following for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member:
* (1) Inspect and copy the records containing members' names, addresses, and voting rights during usual business hours on five days' prior written demand on the corporation, which must state the purpose for which the inspection rights are requested; or
* (2) Obtain from the secretary of the corporation, on written demand and tender of a reasonable charge, a list of names, addresses, and voting rights of members who are entitled to vote for directors as of the most recent record date for which that list has been compiled, or as of the date, after the date of demand, specified by the member. The demand shall state the purpose for which the list is requested. The secretary shall make this list available to the member on or before the later of ten days after the demand is received or the date specified in the demand as the date as of which the list is to be compiled.

The corporation may, within ten business days after receiving a demand under this Section, make a written offer of an alternative method of reasonable and timely achievement of the proper purpose specified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the membership list. Any rejection of this offer must be in writing and must state the reasons the proposed alternative does not meet the proper purpose of the demand.

If the corporation reasonably believes that the information will be used for a purpose other than one reasonably related to a person's interest as a member, or if it provides a reasonable alternative under this Section, it may deny the member access to the membership list. Any inspection and copying under this Section may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.
===b. Accounting Records and Minutes===
On written demand on the corporation, any member may inspect, copy, and make extracts of the accounting books and records and the minutes of the proceedings of the members, the board of directors, and committees of the board at any reasonable time for a purpose reasonably related to the member's interest as a member. Any such inspection and copying may be made in person or by the member's agent or attorney. This right of inspection extends to the records of any subsidiary of the corporation.
===c. Maintenance and Inspection of Articles and Bylaws===
This corporation shall keep at its principal California office the original or a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date, which shall be open to inspection by the members at all reasonable times during office hours. If the corporation has no business office in California, the secretary shall, on the written request of any member, furnish to that member a copy of the articles of incorporation and bylaws, as amended to the current date.
==14.2. Directors' Right to Inspect==
Every director shall have the absolute right at any reasonable time to inspect the corporation's books, records, documents of every kind, physical properties, and the records of each subsidiary. The inspection may be made in person or by the director's agent or attorney. The right of inspection includes the right to copy and make extracts of documents,
=Article 15. Required Reports=
==15.1. Annual Report==
The board shall cause an annual report to be sent to the members and directors within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year. That report shall contain the following information, in appropriate detail:
:(a) The assets and liabilities, including the trust funds, of the corporation as of the end of the fiscal year;
:(b) The principal changes in assets and liabilities, including trust funds;
:(c) The corporation's revenue or receipts, both unrestricted and restricted to particular purposes;
:(d) The corporation's expenses or disbursements for both general and restricted purposes;
:(e) Any information required by Section 14.1.c. of these bylaws; and
:(f) An independent accountants' report or, if none, the certificate of an authorized officer of the corporation that such statements were prepared without audit from the corporation's books and records.

This requirement of an annual report shall not apply if the corporation receives less than $25,000 in gross receipts during the fiscal year, provided, however, that the information specified above for inclusion in an annual report must be furnished annually to all directors and to any member who requests it in writing. If the board approves, the corporation may send the report and any accompanying material sent pursuant to this section by electronic transmission.
==15.2. Annual Statement of Certain Transactions and Indemnifications==
As part of the annual report to all members, or as a separate document if no annual report is issued, the corporation shall, within 120 days after the end of the corporation's fiscal year, annually prepare and mail, deliver, or send by electronic transmission to each member and furnish to each director a statement of any transaction or indemnification of the following kind:
:(a) Any transaction
::(i) in which the corporation, or its parent or subsidiary, was a party,
::(ii) in which an &quot;interested person&quot; had a direct or indirect material financial interest, and
::(iii) which involved more than $50,000 or was one of several transactions with the same interested person involving, in the aggregate, more than $50,000. For this purpose, an &quot;interested person&quot; is either
:::(1) any director or officer of the corporation, its parent or subsidiary (but mere common directorship shall not be considered such an interest); or
:::(2) any holder of more than 10 percent of the voting power of the corporation, its parent, or its subsidiary. The statement shall include a brief description of the transaction, the names of interested persons involved, their relationship to the corporation, the nature of their interest in the transaction and, if practicable, the amount of that interest, provided that if the transaction was with a partnership in which the interested person is a partner, only the interest of the partnership need be stated.
:(b) Any indemnifications or advances aggregating more than $10,000 paid during the fiscal year to any officer or director of the corporation under Article 11 of these bylaws, unless that indemnification has already been approved by the members under Corporations Code section 5238(e)(2).</text>

'''CNC Mill''' or '''computer numerical controlled milling device''' is used for automatically milling or cutting away at materials like wood, plastic, or softer metals such as aluminum based on a 3D computer model.

Akin to a [[Printing|3D Printer]], the CNC provides the ability to work with objects in x, y, and z dimensions. However, it provides ''subtractive'' manufacturing, rather than ''additive''. 

The sudo room sign by the intercom at the old 22nd st entrance was milled on such a machine!

The Noisebridge wiki contains much knowledge about using CNC mills for example '''TO MILL CIRCUITBOARDS''':

[[File:Our new CNC.JPG|thumb|right|our new cnc]]

We have a real CNC Mill as of January 2015.  It belongs to Pam and is on-loan.
It is a  [[myDIYCNC]] [http://www.mydiycnc.com/project%20overview link] cnc thing

Problems:  For some reason, LinuxCNC thinks &quot;home&quot; is at 5.5&quot;, 0&quot;, 0&quot; which is not where I would home it.  I put sharpie marks to indicate the center of travel for X and Y, which is 6.0&quot;,3.5&quot;.  I set the proper numbers in the configuration but it doesn't do what it should.  Whatever.

You need to boot the computer to the LINUXCNC operating system, not the Ubuntu 14.04 installed by Big Ed

The USB adaptor it came with is total garbage, and the software offered by &quot;my DIY CNC&quot; is proprietary, so it is plugged into the parallel port of a desktop computer instead, and we are using LinuxCNC software as seen here: http://www.linuxcnc.org/

We'll be learning how to use this and adding more documentation here.

== The Past ==

* [[JacksMill]] In the past jack lent us his CNC mill which we used to cut wood. It was at the old SudoRoom. It is no longer at the SudoRoom but it left behind some awesome memories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1854">The [http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OFD/s/CORE/index.htm CORE] I course will be offered at Sudo Room on Thursday, Feb. 21st from 6:30-9:30pm. 

The CORE I class teaches students how to prepare a family disaster plan, reduce common household hazards, create emergency supply kits, and respond to a number of possible emergencies, including earthquakes and fires.

From the [http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OFD/s/CORE/index.htm website]: 
:&quot;CORE is a free training program for individuals, neighborhood groups and community-based organizations in Oakland. The underlying premise is that a major disaster will overwhelm first responders leaving many citizens on their own for the first seven to 10 days after the emergency.

:CORE teaches self-reliance skills and helps neighborhoods establish response teams to take care of the neighborhood until professional emergency personnel arrive.&quot;

This is the first in a series of three classes.  In the CORE II class, folks learn how to organize a neighborhood command post and create emergency response teams, (i.e. communications, damage assessment, hazard reduction/utilities, search and rescue, disaster first aid, shelter and special needs).

==RSVP List==
We need 15 confirmed attendees in order to proceed!

(Please use the Signature icon above to register for this course, or send an email to jenny [at] thepyre [dot] org!)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2874">= Reading all the tags =

Someone already wrote a program and made a simple instruction for building the hardware that lets you read every type except for the &quot;Avid Encrypted&quot; tags, which can be read but not decrypted. They also put a web API online for decrypting the Avid Encrypted tags and they have instructions for how to build your own decryptor (they call it a &quot;translator&quot;), however building the decryptor requires a [http://www.allvetsupply.com/miun.html ~$300 piece of hardware]. Everything is [http://max-gpl.sourceforge.net/ here].

= Standards and &quot;Standards&quot; =

All chips operate at either 125 kHz (ISO) or 134.2 kHz (proprietary) but a scanner using either frequency can read both types:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Although ISO chips are optimized for 134.2 kHz, in practice they are readable at 125 kHz and the &quot;125 kHz&quot; chips are readable at 134.2 kHz. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
-- from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchip_implant_(animal)#Cross-compatibility_and_standards_issues this section on wikipedia]

== ISO 11784 &amp; 11785 ==

Includes half-duplex (HDX) and full-duplex (FDX) types. I've seen references to FDX-A and FDX-B but unsure of the difference.

* juul ordered a bunch of FDX-B chips
* HDX are available on aliexpress for ~$20 for 10x but haven't been ordered since they are generally not used in pets

Readers retail for ~$150 on ebay.

* [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_11784_%26_11785 wikipedia article]

Sourcing:

* juul ordered and received a Hitag S256 chips.
* juul ordered 10x [http://www.ebay.com/itm/10pcs-EM4305-ISO11784-85-FDX-B-2-12-12mm-RFID-microchip-Animal-glass-tags/302319562649?ssPageName=STRK%3AMEBIDX%3AIT&amp;_trksid=p2060353.m2749.l2649 FDX-B chips from ebay]
* juul ordered 10x FDX-A aliexpress... maybe. They are listed as both ISO FDX-A and Fecava at the same time. According to [http://maxmicrochip.com/ISO_types.htm Max] these types are actually using the ISO FDX-A standard but with every bit in the protocol inverted. The ones ordered are more likely ISO FDX-A than true Fecava.

== Trovan ==

Also known as Trovan Unique. Also used by some HomeAgain chips and Bayer chips.

We have not been able to source these.

== FECAVA / Destron ==

Used by:

* Avid EuroChip
* 24PetWatch
* Original HomeAgain chip

Sourcing:

* juul ordered 10x of these from aliexpress... maybe. They are listed as both ISO FDX-A and Fecava at the same time. According to [http://maxmicrochip.com/ISO_types.htm Max] these types are actually using the ISO FDX-A standard but with every bit in the protocol inverted. The ones ordered are more likely ISO FDX-A than true Fecava.

== AVID Friendchip ==

Also known as Avid Encrypted. 

* juul ordered a single on of these from ebay. It cost $33 which is why he only ordered one.
:juul received it!

*Mill-produced graphical record of tonight
*Fix the bikes at Chez Hack!
*Hack label printers? Smartphone printers
*UI/UX design for Mycelia

=Wikitown/camper-deployment=

Desired outcome of conversation:
*Clarity on current state + idea
*Potentially a time set for deployment along with actionitems.
*Phase developments / patterns: From scouting, to camper, to tent site to 
*Pickup truck, folks to pick up campers, places to put them.
**Eg Adeline empty lot, Matt's street in Oakland, a few spots in SF
**Construction materials, furnishings, servers
*Create instructables [[Free materials, furnishings, resources, multimedia| for making Wikitown out of recycled materials]]
*BAHT: Bay Area Hacker Transit - network of folks to pick up materials for hackerspaces
*Focus on Craigslist Free in Marin!
*Also LA - Beau's friend has a warehouse, we can store in Badlands.

*Application process for potential tenants
*Desert property for Sober Veggie House, general hacker rehab :)
*Non-profit and trust to create sustainable model
*Property in the desert
*Hacker-in-Residence program - sync with Praveen and Christina

Using campers for establishing beach head at an empty piece of land. Sort of a basecamp to work from - once you got a camper there, you can go there and hang out.

=== Process ===
*Go to lot and prepare road
*Create foundation (concrete?) for camper
*Bring it in!

=== Once successfully deployed ... ===
*Build a fence
*Create a tent-structure

==Campers as mini-hackerspaces==
Patterns of hackerspaces:
*Scout
*Potential mothership addition in caravan + community?

What is the minimum 'stuff' required for X people to go out there and hack for 72 hours?

== Currently... ==
*Tim has 2 campers and properties in CA.
*We can gather free materials for everything we need to establish a wikitown, as long as we got infrastructure to get it (trucks and people) and space to store it.

=== Potential Properties to Pilot on ===
In CA, there are several in the high desert, less than 2 hours from LA. There are 2 in Lake country, and three in North East California not far from the Oregon and Nevada border.

*10 acres of farmland.
*reachable by public transit 
*Gets a few feet of snow in the winter
*Needs a well [http://www.youtube.com/user/dawmlw?v=XGq0ETzZP0E].
*Has a tractor
*2 other properties in the national forest
*free campground nearby
*beautiful!

=Caravan/mycelia/BACH=
*Starting in the Bay Area, weekly
*Teacher Buses, Occupy Oakland bus, Anthony Di Franco, whale bus Tim mentioned
*First weekend: hit Reno by way of Sacramento
*Documentary/video along the way (Two Hands Project)
**Building awareness among non-hackers
**Involving people in an inter-hackerspace community
**Education and DIY inspiration
**After watching video --&gt; inspire people to help out in specific ways
**Video portal
**OpenSim telepresence
***Helping set up a good video space (eg as in sudo or NB)
***Needs to be able to fold out, be more affordable
***Knob for switching between hackerspaces
***Donated plasma screens
***WebRTC?
*Workshops 
**Intro to Electronics
**Intro to Hackerspaces
**[[Hacking hackerspaces| Hacking on hackerspaces]] - helping to build infrastructure, set up a mesh node  &lt;&lt; Mesh node**: wifi via space? will the eco-village have wifi?

=Property searching=
*GIS files w/ parcel outlines
*Analysis of flood plain areas, toxic sites etc
*Tabular data [eg value of improveements, use code, etc]
*Tax collector data
*Zoning, road access, access to water, 
*Hen Foundation, Noisebridge
*Set up payment plan
*Loans for the non-profit
*Scope the potential properties thoroughly
*Participation with the surrounding community
*Development
**Many of the properties are mix-zoned
*Couple shipping containers, maybe 4 tiny homes, gardens / landscaping, and some tents
*Under 30k is the goal
*Needs hosting for qGIS data
*Collect data on the properties from the County Office, Building Safety - name &amp; address of property owner
**Permits, code violations, etc
**County Recorder's office for documents

=SKD (Sofa King Duet)=
* Could we use one of the offices available connected to sudo's common room to launch a coworking space/business? Budget: 2k(ish)/month 

=Interpersonal Ecosystem=
*Essentially - hate to say it - a Facebook for hackers [http://github.com/em-che| like github?]
*This clearly ties in to Mycelia - how to implement on the UI level? --&gt; Hack night
*Project-based system (again see Mycelia) that serves as a matchmaking platform between people, project, skills, ideas, spaces, etc
*More on focused convo to come!

==Outcomes==

===Projects===
* Simple Plywood Furniture
** Making simple furniture with simply a standard large piece of plywood. 
* Maybe rebuild the dome structure, part of mobile infrastructure??
* Worked on some CSS, but finished it at 3am. 
** Vertical and horizontal fixed position layers for keeping links active, using susy ruby gem (compass and sass). 
* Really nice bicycles out around the property, we could repair them 
* Continue meta-discussions
* Working on mesh wifi links, etc. 
* Just opened up a coleman camping freezer--possible bio freezer by converting it to cryogenic. (Get to -40C). 
* Looked into hackerspace infrastucture extended labitrack with a video portal between the spaces.
** Turns out you can do all this stuff in the web browser, hopefully we can get a portal between the other hackerspaces.
* Took apart boat engine, found manual, read about it
* Kept MAPS conference crew fed, very grateful for that. Crazy to feed people for 4 days, Ray was amazing.
* Sudo Room, future directions, meta-space-collaborations have been great
* Weekend itself was a project! 
** Power and internet worked out great, rest is easier to figure out.
** This should be broadened to a bigger project, set up some servers, do some cabling.
** Experience of doing some basic stuff is really enabling and exciting.
* Sudo [[Zine]]!!!! Magazine in the form of a box full of things, that will weave all the different disciplines, talents, narrative, objects, etc! 
* [[Inventory | 3D scanned objects]]
* Fund-raising through gaming engine on Raspberry Pi.
* Sudo Room bible (working title, another fund-raiser)
** Romy started drawings, need to scan them still!
* Going to do a geo-fencing project, but qualcomm removed the feature in their proprietary SDK, so Romy wants to use more open source tools.
** Turn on an app that does different things when you're in a different location.

===Next Steps===
* Bicycle tools for old bikes
* Finish plywood furniture (one stool done)
* Fix jacuzzi (started cleaning)
* Finish video and item tracking portal between Chez Hack and Sudo room
* Three on-board boat motors need continued work.
* Vastly expand the network infrastructure. 
* Hackatorium/Hacker Gallery resource needs some work
* Need to find a spot to set up a drop-off point for future projects. 
* Reach out to Hacker Hostel in Nevada, integrated with burner community.
** They have a general rule--anyone is welcome, &quot;Bring Something&quot;
** Bring yourself of course, but bring a bag of ice, bring some food, bring something to hack on.
* Infrastucture-wise
** Ambulance in Castro Valley, participated in events, but wants some more people involved, open the project up.
** &quot;Hacker Caravan&quot; 
** Has a flatbed trailer, go anywhere for 30 days and be totally self-sufficient. 
* Expand to the rest of the bay area hacker community, learn a lot from this event and grow.
* Solar power is cool, want to use it in general, portable units, etc.
* Hack-a-shack camper, needs some more development. If you have some vacant land, this would be a good option to set up a 'stead. 
** Do wood-working, add infrastructure to the camper.
* Chez Nottebahm is great, but something this great could be done with re-cycled materials and kept simpler.
** Focus on &quot;buying a home&quot; is an unsustainable impediment to their life and freedom!
** Some land available, [http://www.cooperativehomesteads.com/ http://www.cooperativehomesteads.com/]
* Make an &quot;Internet-Free Zone&quot; as a part of the Hacker Sanctuary.

===Thorns and Roses===
* Matt
** T: Pollen, appreciating being outside, going outside when it's not so pollinated.
** R: The beautiful locale 
* Morten:
** T: 
** R
* Marc:
** R: Getting away from everything! Needs to happen from time to time, every few months.
** T: Recreate more feel of hacker camps -- a couple of scheduled talks/activities, maybe just talks so people can relax and listen.
* Marina:
** R: Come to this beautiful place, most time together with a group of people. It hit another level in terms of amount of time talking with each other.
** T: Wish we could spend more time prioritizing and understanding each other, what we all want to work on. We're all tackling different pieces of the elephant, so we should coordinate.
* Tommy
** R: Being able to hack in a space we're not always working in--talking about Sudo Room out of context, having time to think--very nice for that.
** T: I wish I brought more than my laptop--absurd debian install all weekend!!! Didn't expect that
* Jenny
** T&amp;R: Wish I could have spent the entire weekend here because it was so great! Although, it did create an opportunity. It was a great end goal to get back here. This is and end-goal model for what I want to be doing in the future, not just on weekends. Not sure the city is a long-term option for me. I wish I could have spent more time here and that we do it again in the future.
* JC
** R: Thinking about it for a while, been involved in a number of large events and other things, where I have a different style, kind of crazy. I usually spend most of the year planning, and most of the weeks executing. This turned out extremely well in being self-organized, instead of being unorganized. It is due to Sudo Room, based on what we've been doing. SR has been able to create a community who has been able to extend here. It's awesome to have a real hackerspace community step out in to a weekend that isn't defined by drama, chaos, and bullshit. Ya'll have been incredibly great. I think this is a great inspiration and model for hackerspaces and communities in general. Couldn't be happier about that.I would have expected to be the thorn--that food and basics could have been issues. I noticed more in european hacking communities that they come together over meals and food. 
** T: I'd like to see the hackerspace be more self-supportive, be more self-sufficient, have our own portable infrastructure. We should be able to be portable, go out further in the woods, etc.
* Jae
** R: This is exactly what I wanted. It's just so relaxing. I should get out more because this is so nice.
** T: Don't have any. The pollen isn't even that bad.
* Tim
** R: All you people! Did some hacking, having a good time. Thinking of the possibilities of transitioning from the traditional infrastructure of a house and trappings to something else, something closer to where we came from.
** T: The house itself represents a huge expense, and it's not a real viable options even given how big and beautiful it is. I think it's much more beautiful to exist closer to nature, find a way to make what we do portable, etc, so we don't ''have'' to have this infrastructure. 
* Romy
** R: I did like the house, so much inspiration, even the magazines! I thought we'd just party all weekend, but we're all such workaholics that we all wanted to get stuff done. Loved the teenagers and Beau's mom! She was so wacky!
** T: It would have been nice to have other people from sudo room as well as other hackerspace folk, like Praveen, etc. On the other hand, it was just the right size of people. If it was too many it would have been more fractured. This was a constantly flux of people mixing. I would love to see the projects completed! I started working on a project but it was on my own, so I'll share next.</text>

==Session 1==
===City of Oakland 101===
Karen Boyd

City Charter is at the core of the city's legal operations and governance structure.

The mayor is the CEO, appoints City Administrator, is able to resolve a tying vote with the City Council, and also appoints folks to boards and comissions. There are lots of opportunities there and is a great way to get involved.

Districts review, . Lynett Macelhaney (spelling?) new for District 3 (sudo's district). Rebecca Kaplan is the member at large. City's Attorney Office -- advice and representation for the whole organization (Advice unit and Litigation unit). Protect the city's interest, defend the city in lawsuits (litigation), pursue lawsuits, and deal with liability

City auditor is the watchdog of the city, look for evidence of fraud and that the city follows the letter of the law. The audit both day-to-day performance and financial information. 

Office of the City Administrator, Deanna Santana, manages all day-to-day functions--she is the buffer between the Council and city staff (if there's a problem on either side). She's totally excited about &quot;innovation&quot; and will be talking later.

With respect to education, the city does work with the School District, but it's an independently elected board. Jean Quan was on the school board, as well as the new city council rep for the Fruitvale district. 

Planning, permitting, zoning, housing, housing projects. However there is a HOusing Authority which is independent from the city.

Most of the human services are delivered by Alameda County, but there is a department in the City of Oakland. Most federal money comes through the county for these purposes. 

Economic development, business attraction, army bases, and also around the port of Oakland. The port under a charter is a department of the city, but the board of port comissioners is appointed by the Mayor, and there will be a new president of this board coming in soon.

Infrastructure. By and large all the infrastructure is managed by the city (lights, traffic control, streets, sewers, all of that).

Who are the city's customers anyway? Quotes someone else: &quot;You have to really love public service to do this job. And if you don't like service and you don't like the people, this might not be the right job for you.&quot; Oakland is an outward-focusing 

Residents, businesses, agencies (counties, state, fed), but the city itself is a customer--they provide each other services.

What is good customer service? Genuine desire to help other folks, values-oriented, working hard. 

Notion of what it is to be a public servant-- &quot;we are the guardians of the public trust&quot; if you don't like something--you can't go to Walmart, the city has a monopoly on public services. City employees should be ambassadors in their communities. Oakland residents are very generous with tax dollars, and when they feel like they are not benefiting from their city's services, they don't feel trust with the city.

Most civil servants are put through a competitive hiring process--many of them are organized in labor unions: police, fire fighters, professional employees, service employees (street sweepers, administrative staff, etc). Labor negotiations are coming up. Employees are incredibly generous in maintaining staff in the face of cuts. Every few years &quot;Memoranda of Understanding&quot; are re-negotiated. 

====&quot;Black boxes&quot;====

Q: How do we change the city charter?
A: 

Q: What are the different ways measures can be put on the ballot, and what are the thresholds? (a) for city council and (b) up to the voters
A: '''Demystify the measures:''' Money requires 2/3, rank choice? simple majority, and taxes have to go to the voters. (More details). Fees can be imposed by the city council (things that recoup costs, administrative and operational). 2-year budget, but every year the city re-evaluates its master fee schedule and may increase or decrease fees, etc.

Q: Top two or three opportunities (what's needed?)
A: Just launched &quot;MindMixer&quot; engageoakland.com -- looking for feedback. It's brand new, Nicole reads it, and different staff read it as relevant. They think it's a great place. 

Q: Outstanding issues or day-to-day problems of the city government.
A: Compliance with Oakland Police Department potential federal take-over. Also, downsizing with no adjustment in expectation for service delivery. Council expects as much if not more with city staff. Have not interface with the public about not being able to maintain the same capacity. Thinks that Code for America can provide an opportunity to increase efficiency be eliminating complex, paper-based processes. But it becomes very calcified and not able to move as nimbly, with fewer staff today. Most are administrative processes w/o having to change the City Charter. Public Records system is not working well. Further, contracting needs some improvement. Comparative to other cities, IT staff is extremely limited. We need technology, we need training, and we need new systems. 
Some examples from Public Works -- only 2 people on the help desk (8 to 5), longer than 6 months to get a new hire. 20% salary cut in furlough days. Lots of thoughts and feelings.

Q: What kind of data do department heads get on a regular basis? 
A: It's not good. It's getting better, even over the current year. Professional and trained staff are open to improving this. Internal technology systems are really limited.

Q: What are the avenues for citizens to be heard? (Any particular stories?)
A: 

Q: What roles does the city see as its lack of core competency and thus ripe for reaching for outside contractors?
A:

[[File:Recycle Sign.jpg|thumb|right|200px|for a while people had no idea we had a recycle trash can. R made one during our last cleaning of natural decay]]

== Overview ==

Every Sunday (and especially 7pm – 9pm)  is the casual, but collectively necessary, day to clean our wonderful hackerspace. We all make messes, and even if we pick up after ourselves (we really, really must), there is still left-over, natural decay. Some call it a “tragedy,” but why be so melodramatic?

Sunday is a day to recognize, honor, and celebrate decay–through restoration, through cleaning.

== Sundays ==

Sunday is a good time to clean the natural decay. We are a social bunch, racuous and merry. There are great movie nights and social hours in the wee hours of Friday and Saturday, plus man visitors come. Sunday is a good time to pick up the happy burrito wrappers, the old beer bottles (to be reused and turned into SudoMate or Subilr!), scraps of paper to be recycled, and stale take-out food to be composted.

== Themed Cleaning Nights ==

Sometimes we theme our cleaning nights. We had a French New Wave theme where we urged people to come dressed as a Godard film actor or actress. 

Sometimes people bring great heaping dishes of yummy food for a common &quot;let's eat while we clean&quot; glorious dinner.

== Benefits ==

What's in it for you? We know you're a nice person but isn't cleaning pretty boring?

* Sometimes we clean and we're dancing while we do it. We listen to Erasure or even hug. I'm not joking--I have (encrypted, private, non public) videos to show it. just ask us. These things do happen.

* When any landlord we may have now or in the future sees us cleaning and sees us conscientously recycling and taking out the garbage, it creates a better relationship. 

* Cleaning the common space is a great way to do community service! It doesn't just have to be about paying taxes or giving big donations. 

* When people clean together, they bond in a cosmically happy way. Something about cleaning stuff up creates lots of little jokes, people reveal their hopes and dreams, and let their guard down. When people clean together they often stop trying so hard to be cool all the time. The posturing drops.

* Ever wonder what the hell something was but was too afraid or lazy to ask? when you're cleaning in the wood shop, you  get to ask how to clean something and inadvertently learn more and more about what it is. It might lead to a great idea.

* You get a really nice overview of projects that other people are working on that have nothing to do with what you are doing. If you usually program in Python but never touch the biohacking equipment, it's good to just go near and understand what's there. You also learn that some things are sensitive for the biohacking projects that aren't so sensitive for other things--that biohacking projects are easily contaminated, that they have to remain at a certain temperature. 

* You become aware of resources that are there that nobody at the space realized was there. Someone might be doing a sewing workshop the next day but not realize that there are two gigantic bags of fabric scraps in the back room. Someone who did cleaning Sunday night might tip someone giving a class the next day that those scraps of fabric are there... !

* By cleaning you get agency and more personal motivation to do things in the space, to move things around and make them more useful to members and visitors.</text>

This is also hand in hand with our sister hackrrspace Noisebridge Coed Algorithm Class

''Algorithms are beautiful, and they shouldn't just be to pass a class or to ace a coding interview''

* Notes &amp; Github repo: https://github.com/romyilano/AlgorithmsCoed
* Events: Sundays 2-4pm at Noisebridge, off an on at SudoRoom

While this usually happens at Noisebridge, the SudoRoom study groups will involve more drawing and art and poetry.
Maybe even some social activism interwoven into the code!

As the movements for social change become more sophisticated, the techniques of the state, corporations and the right wing have also become more sophisticated. Historically this has always been the case; caution in the face of the concerted effort to stop us, however, is both prudent and necessary.

Here are some useful suggestions:

*If you wish to have a private conversation, leave your home and your office and go outside and take a walk or go somewhere public and notice who is near you. Never say anything you don't want to hear repeated when there is any possibility of being recorded.
*Never leave one copy of a document or list behind; take a minute to duplicate an irreplaceable document and keep the duplicate in a safe place. Back up and store important computer disks off site. Sensitive data and membership list should be kept under lock and key.
*Keep your mailing lists, donor lists and personal phone books away from light fingered people. Always maintain a duplicate.
*Know your printer if you are about to publish.
*Know your mailing house.
*Know anyone you are trusting to work on any part of a project that is sensitive.
*Don't hire a stranger as a messenger.
*Sweeps for electronic surveillance are only effective for the time they are being done, and are only effective as they are being done if you are sure of the person(s) doing the sweep.
*Don't use code on the phone. If you are being tapped and the transcript is used against you in court, the coded conversation can be alleged to be anything. Don't say anything on the phone you don't want to hear in open court.
*Don't gossip on the phone. Smut is valuable to anyone listening; it makes everyone vulnerable.
*If you are being followed, get the tag number and description of the car and people in the car. Photograph the person(s) following you or have a friend do so.
*If you are followed or feel vulnerable, call a friend; don't &quot;tough it out&quot; alone. They are trying to frighten you. It is frightening to have someone threatening your freedom.
*Debrief yourself after each incident. Write details down: time, date, occasion, incident, characteristics of the person(s), impressions, anything odd about the situation. Keep a &quot;weirdo&quot; file and keep notes from unsettling situations and see if a pattern emerges.
*Write for your file under the FOIA and pursue the agencies until they give you all the documents filed under your name.
*Brief your membership on known or suspected surveillance.
*Report thefts of materials from your office or home to the police as a criminal act.
*Assess your undertaking from a security point of view; understand your vulnerabilities; assess your allies and your adversaries as objectively as possible; do not underestimate the opposition. Do not take chances.
*Recognize your organizational and personal strengths and weaknesses.
*Discuss incidents with cohorts, family and membership. Call the press if you have hard information about surveillance or harassment. Discussion makes the dirty work of the intelligence agencies and private spies overt.</text>

== HOW DO WE CREATE.... ==

...social life beyond the rat-race competition for scarce resources?

...a broadly shared sense of our interdependence, based on concrete experience and not just good intentions?

...public decision making that reflects the diverse insights and experiences of all?

...a working model of collective power emphasizing the regular actions of many over the extraordinary actions of a few?

== IMAGINE ==

that in Oakland, community forums are regularly held in every neighborhood - 
in libraries, churches, schools, and other community spaces.
     
People come together to discuss the important issues of their neighborhoods and of the city.

Unlike the usual sorts of public forums where officials where officials deliberate with                   token input from ordinary folks, these gatherings are run by people in the community.

At these empowered ''Neighborhood Assemblies'' people do not merely make reccomendations or share their opinions.

They make fundamental decisions.

They decide how the city is run.

They decide the city budget.

What percentage should go to police, to youth programs, parks, transits, etc.?

What new programs do we need?

Which programs do we phase out? Etc.


Although city staff provide necessary technical expertise, reports, etc., and city officials continue to do the detailed day - to - day work of managing city business, 

the fundamentals of how our city works - as reflected in our budget - is decided directly by we the people.            
  

We will have strong participatory democracy at the local level.

This bottom up &quot;people's budgeting&quot; program could be a template for other cities to follow,
and could scale up to inspire the deepening democracy at the county, state, and even national level.


By bringing people together to discuss, debate, and decide on concrete issues that affect their lives,
the ''Neighborhood Assemblies'' would help thousands of people in Oakland - from all walks of life - improve their communication, critical thinking, and leadership skills by building collective understanding and colective power.

This is exactly the kind of culture shift our society needs.

== Your City. Your Budget. Imagine That. ==

== ''Join our campaign as we rewrite the rules in Oakland.''==

# The issue is added to the official '''sudo room''' wiki to be added to the agenda of the next official meeting, save any issues with significant privacy concerns.
# At the beginning of each meeting's agenda item on Enforcement and Conflict Resolution, all unresolved issues on the wiki will be categorized into one of several types.

=====Sub-Section 3.6.0 Assets=====
* '''sudo room''' assets are managed through member benefits above and the budgeting process below.
=====Sub-Section 3.6.1 Budgeting=====
'''sudo room''' employs a transparent, and collaborative budgeting process that attempts to reflect the shared values of all members as articulated by the group's purpose. The budget is located (insert link here). It is managed through the following procedure each month:

# Determine if membership dues can be reduced
# Transparently prioritize budget allocations. (In no particular order) allocate income to match expenditures, contribute to standing funds, and determine remaining surplus
# Any surpluses that remains will be divided based on member contribution and treated as ''internal credits'' (or a ''soft dividend'') available for members to:
## Leave to the discretion of '''sudo room''' to allocate
## Allocate in the budget, at the member's discretion, to various available '''internal projects''' as defined below.
## Provide as future contributions to membership dues.
* '''Note:''' there is a substantial distinction for ''external projects'' as defined below.

* To ensure stability, '''sudo room''' must maintain several standing funds:
** 3 months worth of rent + utilities
** Rainy Day fund (for emergency expenditures)
** Maintenance fund (for necessary infrastructure replacements)
** Operations fund (for necessary, small operational expenditures)

=====Sub-Section 3.6.2 Income=====
'''sudo room''' accrues income through several sources, including events, crowd-funding initiatives, and membership dues.

=====Sub-Section 3.6.3 Dues=====
The recommended monthly dues for members is calculated as follows:
* dues = average over all members of ( 1 month's overhead + a % of any defecit in each standing fund + a risk premium (min. 5% of all other dues components)
** For instance, early on, overhead could be (rent + utilities + services), in which case dues = (500 + 100 + 20 + (10 + 5 + 0 + 10) + 64) / 23 = $30.83 per member

=====Sub-Section 3.6.4 Expenditures=====
* Internal Projects
** Infrastructure, maintenance and improvements.
** Capital Projects
* External Projects
** Not funded this way. Use alternative methods, such as through discounts or crowd-funding opportunities offered as Benefits above.
=====Sub-Section 3.6.5 Surplus=====
'''sudo room''' strives to maintain a zero-sum budget, in which there is no surplus.
* Definition: surplus = income - expenditures - standing funds

==Announcement==

Tech Liminal Lunch Box
Crowdfunding. Wed., Apr. 17, 2013.

Crowdfunding. What does it mean and how does it work? Why is it the biggest buzz word since social media? Will it really circumvent the flow of investment capital to bypass Wall Street? Can it stimulate new jobs in the small business enterprise and contractors markets? 

Is there anything more to this than passing around a hat for donations amongst your friends and family in order to do a project you and they know will never be completed? What is the Securities Exchange Commission worried about that is delaying their implementation of the Crowdfunding provisions of the JOBS Act, which was supposed to go into effect in January?

At Lunch Box, we will address these questions, or at the very least read all of them out loud.

Bring your own lunch box.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9122">Every Third Sunday of the month from 2-5pm, Sudo Room hosts an afternoon of co-learning and teaching about digital security. The driving motivation of our cryptoparties is to learn about end-user security in a fun, welcoming and inclusive environment. Popular topics include: why digital security is important; strategies for activists and journalists; encrypted email; encrypted text messaging; encrypted phone calls; encrypting your hard drive; off-the-record instant messaging; secure web browsing; mesh networks; and presentations on newer projects. All skill levels welcome - bring your phone and/or laptop!

=Hosting A Cryptoparty=
*Cryptoparties are best when some planning takes place before. Hold a planning meeting 1-2 weeks before the event and ping the [https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/cryptoparty mailing list] to recruit folks who've expressed interest in helping out.
*There are handouts linked to above that can be printed out at sudo - they generally live in a clear document holder / trapper keeper labelled 'Cryptoparty' located in a crate of other trapper keepers on the middle shelf between the workshop and the bike station in sudo. 
*Try to reach out to communities that should be using crypto and are generally not connected to the sudo room social network. Activists, journalists, immigrants + expats, POC, etc; Consider hosting the cryptoparty in an entirely different location.
*At least a week before the cryptoparty, get the word out:
**Tweet/FB posts via Sudo Room's accounts (ask Jenny for info)
**Send an announcement to the following mailing lists:
***[https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/sudo-discuss sudo-discuss]
***[https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/cryptoparty cryptoparty]
***[https://lists.noisebridge.net/listinfo/noisebridge-discuss noisebridge-discuss]
*Come half an hour to an hour earlier to set up:
**Put the sudo room sandwich board out 
**Tape up some signage on the doors if so inclined (there are some paper signs in the clear trapper keeper)
**Find a good spot for your expected # of attendees. Check with Public School; often we have split up into several working groups using different areas of the common space, sudo room proper, and the public school room.
*Starting the cryptoparty:
**Take notes on the wiki - set up a separate wiki page for that month's event [eg; /wiki/Cryptoparty/YEAR/MONTHNAME
**Allow 15-30 minutes to get to a good group size to start
**Go around the room and ask folks to introduce themselves, their level of skill w/ crypto, what they're interested in discussing or working on that afternoon.
**Create an agenda ad-hoc and split the group as needed (pairs work great for things like helping someone set up disk encryption)
**Have fun! Encourage wide-ranging discussion but step in if things start to get to technical. Keep focus on those who are newer to the topic and have specific things they want to accomplish.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5186">=Mobile Security=
*Encrypting mobile communications are not completely secure (metadata can still be read), but concealing the contents of communication can provide you with some security
*You can also secure the endpoints - full disk encryption is possible on Android. Settings -&gt; Security, choose option to encrypt your entire device 
*If your device is returned by the state, it's possible there's been 
*Even ordering the phone online can be man-in-the-middle'd
*If you're being stalked (not by the state), it's unlikely they've bugged the hardware itself.
*Different threat is retroactive surveillance - looking through the logs - but much more difficult if you
*Using TextSecure, text messages are encrypted on the phone, unlocked with a password. It's always a good idea to shut down your phone 
*Default text messaging app on Android default is Google Hangouts - make sure to disable it if you're not rooting the phone
**Good idea to take the APK out completely
*Authentication : So long as there's an encrypted connection between two points, most people are not highly concerned about authentication and use a TOFU approach (Trust On First Use)
**End-to-end vs. transport layer encryption
**OTR, PGP, are end-to-end
**You can use Pidgin + OTR and check to ensure it's working by simultaneously running GChat in your browser. If it shows jibberish, you're good! That's what Google sees. 
*Gibberbot, now called ChatSecure, for iOS and Android for instant messaging.
*In order to use fdroid (a free and open source app store for Android), go to Settings, Allow Unknown Sources so you don't need Google's permission to install apps. It's fairly trivial to modify the contents of the APK while it remains signed by Google.
*Recommended to put phones into Airplane mode (or at least toggle off WiFi) so that they're not sending out identifying probe packets. Private corporations can track your movements 
**[http://www.juicedefender.com/ Juice Defender] to turn off your radios for saving battery life.
**It may be possible to spoof your Android's MAC address, some devices

=Anonymity=
*For anonymous browsing, install the Tor Browser Bundle (or Orbot on Android, though not as strong as Tor)
*Tails running off a USB stick is recommended.
**Live distributions ensure you're essentially running the operating system like it's the first time, every time.
***Difficulty is if you need persistent data storage, though Tails also incorporates a persistent volume. 
*Recommended for journalists along with SecureDrop 
*Anonymity vs Security
**Anonymity: Browser headers can be linked to your identity, for instance.
*Panopticlick: Can scan the identifying data on your hard drive
*Tor conceals your IP address, and thus your *location* by routing it through layers of other servers
*Tor Browser Bundle uses a version of Firefox with extended support

=Email=
*There's a plugin for Postfix that automatically encrypts emails sent to you -
*Riseup.net is a trusted and vetted email provider
*Electric Embers, local worker coop, for paid mail hosting
*1984 and Gandi.net for web hosting
*[https://riseup.net Riseup], [https://airvpn.org/ AirVPN], [https://www.ipvanish.com/ IP Vanish]
*[http://www.opensmtpd.org/ OpenSMTPD]
*Cryptobot

=Dropbox=
*Dropbox is not end-to-end encrypted
*Condoleeza Rice is now on the Board of Directors for Dropbox.
*[https://www.boxcryptor.com/ BoxCryptor] for encrypting your cloud storage.
*[https://spideroak.com/ Spider Oak] - Client-side encrypted.
*[http://owncloud.org/ OwnCloud] - Run your own Dropbox. Does not do client-side encryption.
*[http://cozy.io/ Cozy.io] - 
*Or just a copy of Apache with WebDAV
*rsync all the things!

=Note-Taking=
*Etherpad
**Developed for different databases, like NoSQL databases, making fully-replicable Etherpads possible
*[https://workflowy.com Workflowy]

=Legal=
*Will the police force you to input your password?
**No precedent has really been set yet.
**&quot;Expectation of privacy&quot; 
**Australia and the UK will force you to input your password - you can be held in jail until you decrypt it. Which is crazy, considering you can have random bits accumulate on your computer that appear encrypted.
*If its on shared hosting, a hosting provider is required to hand over just the data belonging to the suspect.
*TrueCrypt use raises suspicion, you're expected to have a hidden TrueCrypt volume the password to which must be revealed.
*USB Debugging on allows anyone to access the phone and get content off it, even if the phone is locked.
*Most mobile phones can be pwned almost instantly

=MAC Addresses=
*Difficult to spoof for mobile devices - may be possible on some rooted Android phones
*Macspoofer on Linux - easy!

=Bitcoin=
*What can you buy with Bitcoin?
**CheapAir - flights
**Foodler - food
**Overstock.com
**Tiger Direct
**Alibaba
**Donate to the EFF or to Sudo Room!
*Better to host your own wallet than to use one of the third-party services that could steal your shit.
**Create the wallet while completely offline.
*Lots of altcoins popping up
*Drop in Bitcoin after hedgefund was created to store something like 49 million Bitcoins, though the Bitcoin community seems to have now forgotten about it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2676">This cryptoparty took place on 16 February 2014 with no less than 20 engaged attendees :)

=Areas of Interest=
*Mobile security
*Backups (especially photos)
*Cyanogenmod
*Threat Modelling
*VOIP
*Installing Linux
*Installing [http://keepass.info KeePass2], a password vault program
*Running DNSSEC
*Playing with alternative, secure email systems
*Chat/OTR on Android
*Image metadata

=Agenda=
*Intros and what you're looking to get out of this cryptoparty
*Why security is important
*Split up into groups:
**Mobile security
**Lastpass (password management)
**Threat modelling (eg; activists on the street) 

=Takeaways=
*GPG
*Tails is hard to get running on my machine
*TextSecure is easy!
*Helped people set up secure chats, emails, and texting
*Great one-on-one conversations
*Learned a good deal about KeePass2 (and other variants like KeePassX) and got it running with help!
*Learned about F Droid - an app store for procuring APKs without going through Google Play
*Made a self-signed certificate and locked down CalDav
*Threat modeling - we're not much better prepared than we were with Occupy. As an iPhone user, I'm pretty screwed no matter what. Need to talk to lawyers re: handing over keys and such
*DNSSEC sucks! DNS is already terrible, but DNSSEC makes it worse! Clients don't use it, registrars don't accommodate it, and if you try to use it you're in for a headache.
*The latest version of Cyanogenmod forces you to use their cloud for your contacts, which now must be sync'd with a cloud.
*Suggestion: Cryptoparty Movie Night!
*Suggestion: Linux Install Parties
*Feedback: Splitting the group into &quot;let's do this now&quot; and general discussion was a great idea!
*Homemade vs. commercial Faraday cages for phones, and general physical security
*How to make this knowledge more palatable to the general public? Comics etc;
*Best cryptoparty yet! Folks came with specific questions; paired off really smoothly; no uber-techie debates taking place; specific tasks and breakout topics.

What are you interested in talking about?
*Email encryption
*Bitcoin
*Alternatives to OTR using GPG
*Open Wireless and encrypted wifi networks
*Local encrypted storage with git
*Browser security
*Simplify security process for activists [eg; 'digital security hygiene toolkit']
*Security in general - how to talk to people who don't think security is important
*Homomorphic Encryption project, talk to Ryan Jarvinen @ryanj
*BREACH and dealing iwth HTTP compression working arounds including sanitizing the response body. 
*Does Firefox trust the Chinese government to not forge a fake Certificate through the CNNIC certificate authority
*Convergence.io discussion / review / vulnerabilities
*Hashed.im hackathon

=First Chat=
*How to talk to people about why security is important
*Why, as a general concept, is security important? For instance, assumption is that Google is secure, etc.
*Why should this matter for me, even if I agree it's important in general? For instance, you're not going in to a field where security matters (e.g. physics). But imagine a scenario where you simply meet someone who at some point becomes a target by authorities, including the US government, etc. In this situation, it becomes very difficult and unsafe to communicate, need to invest in security for your protection, and the protection of your community. It belongs to the community, not necessarily individuals, even if you're not personally going to do anything wrong. You may become a victim of surveillance, a target by proxy or by association. 
*Further, you don't even need to break the law to become a victim of surveillance. For instance, in Sweden, a complete list of Roma was created (discrimination). 
*Legislative change could occur, in which your legal activities today could become illegal tomorrow, especially in the context of a dragnet where your history may come back to haunt you.

==Solutions:==
*Look to maintaining institutions that do not make it easy for corruption to take hold.
*So what do you say to someone who doesn't take security seriously?
*E.g. the &quot;The NSA probably has good reasons&quot; - examples like activist Jacob Applebaum can help. On the other hand, a metaphor of &quot;safe sex&quot; using condoms is straight to the point. 
*E.g. Another tactic is hygiene, protection against infection.
*E.g. Also, the community argument holds to remind that you may be putting others at risk. 
*E.g. Martin Luther King Jr.'s historical record of surveillance from the US government is a retrospective example of the affects. 
*Does secure communication highlight you as a target?
*Interestingly, by using secure and encrypted communication, perhaps you can contribute to obfuscating very sensitive secure and encrypted communications, even if yours is not.
*Also, tacitly, you use encryption all the time. There are lots of implemented security systems in place. Often this indicates that you in fact will not appear as a needle in a haystack. 
*Further, you can use strong encryption inside of other encrypted methods (like TLS), which obfuscates the level of security in use.
*Ultimately, it depends on how you use it, and it's possible to flag you. On the other hand, this does bring up the fundamental concern about privacy and secure communication: is it necessary and valuable?
*Encrypting everything can help obscure
*The more people who use encryption, the lower the cost becomes for using it ;)
*ON THAT NOTE, WELCOME TO CRYPTOPARTY!

=Rhodey on SSL / Certificate Authorities=
*SSL / TLS handshake
*Certificates are public keys used to authenticate
*At this step, the session can be man-in-the-middle'd
*The site decrypts the pre-master secret using its private key, then both the user and the site calculate the master secret and generate two session keys, one for encyrption, the other for decryption
*Security Vulnerabilities: SSL 2.0 [DO NOT WANT], TLS 1.1 &amp; 1.2 not widely supported
*Security patches: Disable renegotation; BEAST [disable or sandbox Java in the browser]; CRIME [disable TLS Compression]

=Jae Kwon on Scramble.io, Certificate Authorities, and Perfect Forward Secrecy (TLS v1.2)=
*There are 458 certificate authorities trusted by Ubuntu Linux (operating system) by default. Any one could be compromised to generate fake certificates and access all seemingly secure communication.
*http://convergence.io uses a Notary Model instead of the Certificate Authorities model. Somewhat unmaintained project.
*What convergence.io misses is what is provided by &quot;Perfect Forward Secrecy&quot;
*Without Perfect Forward Secrecy, if you store communication now and are able to get ahold of the private key later, you could decrypt it then. This is called &quot;retroactive decryption&quot;
*Services that previously offered secure email services that have since shut down, notably surrounding NSA surveillance programs, i.e. PRISM.
**Lavabit
**Silent Circle
**TorMail
**HushMail
*One way to deal with this circumstance is to create a service that is not dependent on the server, that is open source, decentralized, and using good crypto.
*Good crypto? 
**RSA2048
**RSA2048 + AES128
***Rob Schneir says this is okay. 
**** just a thought but: 
(isn't this a typo for Bruce ? er Bruce Schneier of https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram.html crypto-gram newsletter?) correct me if i'm wrong =)]]

**OpenPGP

==How it works:==
*Create a message.
*Generate an encrypted session key (AES)
*A session key is used as a matter of performance
*Encrypt the message using that session key
*Use the recipient's public key to encrypt the session key itself!
*Then you can send your encrypted message which can be decrypted in the reverse process with the recipients private key once they get the message

=Bill on OTR=
*Real-time encryption system widely implemented in instant messaging applications
*Transport-layer agnostic
*Enables multi-party communications
*Attackers can see who the communicating parties are, but not what they've said
*These advantages mimic spoken conversation among friends (web of trust model)
*OTRv3 released in 2012
*Diffie-Hellman to establish shared keys
*A way to establish a zero-knowledge secure session over a plaintext transport layer.
*Mathematical principle: it is easy to multiply 2 large primes to arrive at a large prime-product, but difficult -
*Identity verification is a crucial step! Verify fingerprints (eg; PGP) or Socialist Millionaires Protocol
*New in v3: Extra derived key for secure file transfer, voice chat (!!) [not yet implemented]
*Spec Implementations:
**C: libotr
**Java-otr (no longer maintained)
**Javascript otr (new!)
**Applications w/ native support: Adium, Bitlbee
**Plugin support: Pidgin, Kopete, Trillian, irssi, WeeChat, XChat
**The future: mpOTR (multi-party OTR)

=Lightning Talks=
==Bill on Verifiable Builds==
*Apt-get install is not the most trusted way of installing software,  as it was pre-compiled on another machine
*Post by Perry from Tor Project: https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise
*Deterministic builds

==Yan announces 2nd Aaron Swartz Memorial Hackathon==
*November 8-10 at Noisebridge
*AaronSwartzHackathon.Org[https://AaronSwartzHackathon.Org] for more details

==Cryptoreddit==
*http://reddit.com/r/cryptoreddit
*Apply PGP to Reddit threads
*WiFi Probe Requests and Responses
**Open database linking GPS coordinates to MAC addresses
**WiFI Pineapple - http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/wifi-pineapple
*http://lockboxx.blogspot.com 

==Jake on PGP-authenticated Voting==
*Public keys for signing should be signed by a trusted registrar
*These registrars would have to resign keys in person each year; keys expire after one year
*Yet they would still be anonymous even from the registrar [signed using gnuk]
*Needs a super-simple, easy to use front end - 'as simple as making a facebook profile'

==Running Code Securely Using Emulation==
*68K emulation
*very simple

Art, sound, dance and technology COLLIDE.

== Members ==

We are busily absorbing various groups from SudoRoom, Oakland and the Public School. We are interested in infusing art into technology.

= Events =

== [[DanceSoundPerformanceMay| May 3rd, 2013 - Circles &amp; Dance Performance at the Berkeley Museum]] ==
''SudoRoom will be performing a dance in circles of white at the Berkeley Museum. We will be wearing LED costumes. Open to all! Rehearsals are every Saturday at 6pm in SudoRoom.''

= Inspiration =
* SFSU Conceptual/Information Arts (the CIA !) - they are so smart! 
* http://art511spring2012.pbworks.com/w/page/50217819/FrontPage
* http://userwww.sfsu.edu/infoarts/cdmain/res/a511.research.syllabus.html &lt;- unfortunately this professor died, but his class is so cool!

= Patterns =

== '''Happy Patterns''' ==


People hacking things

Dancers speaking one on one with the LED people on interesting things they'd like to do

== '''Anti-Patterns''' ==



Pulling in too many readymade projects with readymade ideas made by other people not part of sudo room in a way that inhibits the creativity of the group.

It's probably not a good idea to involve Zumba, etc. or any franchise corporate fitness movement. They are heavily copyrighted and do not allow hacking / creative extensions.</text>

Part of [[DanceSound]]

We are going to be performing as dancers, in LED costumes, in a healing performance at the Berkeley Museum. 


== May 3rd-2013 - Performance at Berkeley Museum ==
Friday, May 3rd, 2013 7pm

=== Details ===

http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/exhibition/late050313

Programmed by Brontez Purnell
Doors 5:00 / DJ 6:30

''Part dance party, part performance, and part family reunion, Other Dancers brings together cutting-edge experimental dancers and performers from the Yay Area and beyond. The line between artist and audience blurs, and the intrinsic value of movement is explored. Performances by Jennifer Marie Hoff, LoveWarz, Kelly Rafferty, Mica Sigourney, Sophia Wang, and Hentyle Yapp. Also expect a film by Nina Haft and a participatory dance class led by Jesse Hewit. DJ Sets by Josh Cheon (Dark Entries Records) and Robert Yang (a.k.a. Robot Hustle).''


=== Rehearsals ===


Rehearsals 3 Saturdays in April

* April 13, 2013 - 6pm - SudoRoom
* April 19, 2013 - Friday 9pm - Works in progress showing at Berkeley's Foundry s 835 Carleton, at 7th.  Berkeley, CA
* April 20, 2013 - 6pm - SudoRoom
* April 27, 2013 - 6pm - SudoRoom
* April 28, 2013 - April East Bay Sound Art Meetup https://www.facebook.com/events/133861906796107/

=== What Is It? ===

Jen, a dance teacher at the Public School, is having a rehearsal, researching the theme of circles &amp; resonance, and experimenting with lighting.


* Dancers will be dressed entirely in white

We are still free to give her our input!

=== Who Can Dance ===

* Anyone at SudoRoom can participate. You have to wear white. 
* You will  be possibly wearing a costume with LED lights.
* You do not have to go to the rehearsals, but it would be a good idea to do that

=== Hackers ===

How would you like to add to the performance? 

* Wearable electronics (white?) on white-outfitted dancers
* Video - would you like to film the dancers using drones, filmed from strange angles?
* Print or drawing - would you like to make wood sculptures of the performance/ make a letterpress zine?

Please throw some ideas to the list, let's talk!

Wait! don't we have hack the gallery too? Let's talk to patrick!

== Brainstorming ==

* Compass-spaced - lights change depending on which direction the dancers are moving in (Hol)</text>

=Overview=

Current security mechanisms at SudoRoom
* SudoRoom [[Door Access]]
== Questions ==
Just like the oil tribe in Max Max, Sudo Room must learn to protect itself from hostile outside elements without becoming hostile itself.

* How can Sudo Room protect its wiki from spam?
* How can SudoRoom improve the safety of guests, members and citizens living in this slice of Oakland?
* How can we enlist the help of talented hackers to protect us from hostile outside hackers?
* How  can we protect Sudo Room from fungus and mold? They're huge problems! They kill more people than hackers!

We all know super smart people. Wouldn't this be a chance for them to show off how clever they are at being hackers?

= Security Incidents = 
==June2013Robbery==
* June 2013 two SudoRoom members were robbed at gunpoint.

Sudo Room is located in the Omni Oakland Commons Building, at the corner of 48th and Shattuck, in North Oakland.

The nearest major intersection is 51st and Shattuck, right next to the highway 24 on/off-ramps.

The exact address is: 4799 Shattuck, Oakland, CA 94609

We're 1/2 mile north of MacArthur BART station; which is  approximately 10 minutes at average human walking speed.

== How to get in? ==

Our main entrance is the double door under the blue awning. The doorbell is up on the right. 

One of Omni's members made a temporary, makeshift button-dinger, for those who can't reach it without assistance. If the dinger is missing, and you are unable to reach the doorbell on your own, please knock loudly and hopefully we'll hear you!

Members of the Omni can gain access through the use of our [[Door Access|electronic, card-based access system]]. We're currently working on improving this system, including a better, more easily accessible door! Updates coming soon!</text>

= Introduction =

DisasterRadio is an off-grid (solar-powered) low-bandwidth long-range mesh network built on free and open source software and affordable open hardware. 

The nodes are small and entirely self-contained units that can be deployed simply by leaving them in a place with sun. They are intended for either manual or drone-deployment on rooftops or in windows. They use high gain omni-directional antennas on 915 MHz using the LoRa PHY (Chirp Spread Spectrum) to talk to each-other and a downward-pointing/inward-pointing high gain wifi antenna to talk to user devices (phones/tables/laptops) inside the buildings on which they are placed. They use a low-power microcontroller running a web server that lets anyone use the network as long as they have a device with wifi and a web-browser.

= Updates =
* Status as of 31 October 2017: [[User:nanomonkey]] and fritz received the custom PCB boards they designed. got one working tonight \o/
* Status as of June 10th 2017: Basic chat between two nodes working. A more fleshed-out website should appear here soon.

= Applications =

The in-development apps are secure chat and community resource mapping (an offline map that communities can use to add resources, like [http://tidepools.co/ tidepools]).

= Technical Specifications =
* Bandwidth: &lt; 2000 kbits/sec.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1309">The Android app should at minimum contain a browsable offline map of the local area that displays locations of various emergency-relevant services. It should include automatic bluetooth synchronization to receive stations and other phones.

The code is [https://github.com/DisasterRadio/DisasterRadioAndroid available on github].

= Bluetooth =

The bluetooth device discovery and connection from Android phones is working, but we're having trouble connecting to python-bluez examples and currently troubleshooting. Could be because python-bluez is unmaintained since 2009 or because the bluetooth usb sticks we have just plain suck.

Interesting projects:

*[https://github.com/schnej7/Blue-Mesh Blue-Mesh]

= Synchronization =

We'll use a variation on [https://github.com/dominictarr/scuttlebutt scuttlebutt] synchronization that supports receive-only &quot;sync&quot;. Currently porting to Java.

= Maps =

There seem to be two Android map libraries:

*[http://code.google.com/p/mapsforge/ MapsForge] - Vector-based
:Seems like development stopped in late 2012. Map download server is down. I tried it out and while it's pretty fast even on an older phone, the map is not impressive to look at.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2263">= Prototypes =

== Transmitter ==

The first transmitter prototype is using the USRP1 with the WBX daughterboard. We've been testing on 500 mhz.

=== Antenna ===

We're using a &quot;christmas tree&quot;-type pcb antenna from Ettus Research.

== Receiver ==

The receiver prototype is the Elonics E4000 which is a $12 (from china) RTL-SDR device.

=== Receiver antenna ===

We're using the antenna that came with the Elonics E4000 which is fine for short distances.

= Final radio hardware =

== Transmitter ==

Work is currently in progress to design a cheap radio transmitter that plugs into USB. We're trying to keep the price under $150. We have a few design ideas that need to be added to this wiki. A quick overview of current proposed designs:

Something that takes USB input and spits it out through a 200-500 MSPS DAC. This would limit us to 100-250 mhz (probably realistically more like 50-125 mhz, as you don't want to cut it too the Nyquist limit), but would probably be pretty cheap. This could probably be implemented with a cheap FPGA as the only IC and would be really cheap.

We could also do something that isn't a fully general purpose SDR, using e.g. the [http://www.analog.com/en/rfif-components/modulatorsdemodulators/adl5385/products/product.html ADL5385] (30 mhz to 2.2 ghz QAM modulator that takes an I/Q input signal) and the [http://www.analog.com/en/rfif-components/pll-synthesizersvcos/adf4351/products/product.html ADF4351] (35 mhz to 4.4ghz voltage controlled oscillitor). Analog Devices already has a free reference design using these devices. This would mean that the modulation scheme is limited to QAM, but the signal would likely be of high quality and the transmission frequency and power could be varied to a high degree. 

=== Amplifier ===

A transmission amplifier will be needed to make a mesh work with only a few of the nodes capable of transmission. We haven't done any work on this yet.

=== Antenna ===

No work on this yet.

== Receiver ==

We will almost certainly use the Elonics E4000 as the final receiver as well.

=== Antenna ===

The antenna will depend on the frequency range we choose for the transmitter. No work has been done on this yet, but the cost should be kept as low as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2577">This page is currently a bit of a mess, containing only some notes about GNU Radio. Much documentation work needed.

= Source code =

The code is [https://github.com/DisasterRadio/DisasterRadioSDR available on github].

= Interesting links =

*[https://www.cgran.org/wiki/Projects List of awesome GNU Radio projects]

= UHD gain selection =

The command:

  sudo uhd_find_devices

Should list the gain range for the TX or RX frontend of choice.

E.g. for the WBX TX frontend you get:

  Gain range PGA0: 0.0 to 25.0 step 0.1 dB

Make sure you're not looking at the gain range for TX when you're looking to receive or vice-versa, as the won't necessarily be the same!

= GNU Radio UHD device selection =

For a USRP 1 this should be in the form: serial=&lt;hex_serial&gt;. E.g:

  serial=24e6b31a

To find device serial run: 

  sudo uhd_find_devices

You're looking for output that looks like:

 |     _____________________________________________________
 |    /
 |   |       Mboard: USRP1
 |   |   serial: 24e6b31a

To set the sub-device (the daughterboard and channel) use the format:

  &lt;slot_name&gt;:&lt;daughterboard_frontend_id&gt;

E.g:

  B:0

This slot_name and daughterboard_frontend_id are also findable with the command:

  sudo uhd_find_devices

The output you're looking for looks like:

 |   |     _____________________________________________________
 |   |    /
 |   |   |       RX Dboard: B
 |   |   |   ID: WBX, WBX + Simple GDB (0x0053)
 |   |   |     _____________________________________________________
 |   |   |    /
 |   |   |   |       RX Frontend: 0
 |   |   |   |   Name: WBXv2 RX+GDB
 |   |   |   |   Antennas: TX/RX, RX2, CAL
 |   |   |   |   Sensors: lo_locked
 |   |   |   |   Freq range: 68.750 to 2200.000 Mhz
 |   |   |   |   Gain range PGA0: 0.0 to 31.5 step 0.5 dB
 |   |   |   |   Connection Type: IQ
 |   |   |   |   Uses LO offset: No

Specifically the lines:

 |   |   |       RX Dboard: B

and:

 |   |   |   |       RX Frontend: 0

Together making up the B:0.

== For command-line python scripts ==

For command line scripts, device and sub-device is often specified with the --args and --spec arguments. E.g:

  my_script.py --args serial=24e6b31a --spec B:0

This syntax may vary from script to script, but this is the most common syntax.

== For GNU Radio Companion ==

For the &quot;UHD: USRP Sink&quot; in the latest version of grc (as of this writing) the field &quot;Device Addr&quot; would be set to e.g. serial=24e6b31a and the field &quot;Mb0: Subdev Spec&quot; would be set to e.g. &quot;B:0&quot;.

== Revitalize Music ==

Tilo https://soundcloud.com/tilotilo511 created an Arduino sound piece for the  [[http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/WFMU/blog/The_Revitalize_Music_Contest|WFMU Revitalize Music Contest]] 

There are basically some music pieces out there without copyright that are in the free domain. We can reinterpret them as part of this contest! 

Tilo rewrote an 1880 Mormon hymn called [[http://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/god-be-with-you-till-we-meet-again?lang=eng|God be with you until we meet again]] in Arduino.

You can see him setting it up in the photograph.

Here is the finished recording!

= Upcoming Ideas =

In the summer we would like to have a live sound performance at SudoRoom.   We are open to mix any number of themes such as vintage erotica, dance, board games and music, etc. G is brainstorming heavily!

Any such event would be donations and money acquired would go to SudoRoom.

== Jeff's Visit ==

Jeff dropped in for a quick visit. He would like to possibly work with someone at SudoRoom who can handle electronics and setting up devices that listen to buildings. We discussed previous art projects where people listened to plants.

We are going to reach out to CCA, Mills, and possibly people at l'expression digital arts.</text>

This is a list of zones that would work for a BSL-1 or BSL-2 laboratory in the East Bay.

= Berkeley =

Zoning types we can use:

*MM (Mixed Manufacturing) zoning: AUP
*MU-LI (Mixed Use - Light Industrial): UP(PH)

[http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/gis/maproom/Zoning/zoningmap.htm Berkeley zoning map]

= Emeryville =

*MUN: Conditional
*OT: Yes
*OT/DH: Conditional
*INL: Yes
*INH: Conditional
*All others: No

[http://www.ci.emeryville.ca.us/DocumentCenter/View/5916 Emeryville zoning map]

= Oakland =

*[http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/ceda/documents/report/oak032032.pdf The Oakland Planning Code]
*[http://www2.oaklandnet.com/oakca1/groups/ceda/documents/report/oak028431.pdf The Oakland Citywide Zoning Map]

== If we are &quot;Research and Development&quot; ==

*CIX-1: Yes
*CIX-2: Yes
*IG: Yes
*IO: Yes
*CBD-C: Conditional
*CBD-X: Conditional
*CBD-R: No
*CBD-P: No

Any zoning that allows the &quot;Research and development&quot; activity is ok. There are several other zonings that conditionally allow research and development, but it takes 2-4 months and (I think) $1000-$2000 dollars to get the permit. You'd have to begin renting the property immediately.

Though it seems odd. The M-20, M-30 and M-40 zones are no good for us. This means the areas around Linden st. Brewery (3rd and Linden) are no go. The zoning office told Juul that this is because some of the zones, including the M zones, haven't been updated since 1965.

The zone for the sudo room building is unfortunately CBD-P.

== If we are &quot;Research Service&quot; ==

Margot Prado sent us an email indicating that we can fit into the &quot;Research Service&quot; activity type, which is a Commercial Use type rather than the Industrial Use type of the &quot;Research and Development&quot; activity. This opens up many more potential zones.

The official description of &quot;Research Service&quot; is: 

 Research Service Commercial Activities include research of an industrial or scientific nature, other
 than medical testing and analysis and routine product testing, which is offered as a service or which is
 conducted by and for a private profit-oriented firm, other than a public utility firm.

The exclusion of medical testing and analysis could be a problem (especially for the Gonorrhea Eradication Team). However, there is also the &quot;Medical Service&quot; activity, which is also a commercial activity, and it described as:

 Medical Service Commercial Activities include the provision of therapeutic, preventive, or corrective
 personal treatment services by physicians, dentists, psychotherapists, and other practitioners, as well as
 the provision of medical testing and analysis services. They also include certain activities accessory to
 the above, as specified in Section 17.10.040.

In the following list of zones it is specified if Medical is not allowed:

*RM-20: Yes
*RM-30: Yes
*RM-40: Yes
*HBX-1: Yes, but research service not allowed outside.
*CIX-1: Yes
*CIX-2: Yes but medical conditional.
*IG: Conditional and Medical no.
*IO: Yes but Medical conditional.
*CC: Yes
*CBD-R: Yes, but restrictions if NOT on ground floor (L4)(L7)
*CBD-P: Yes, but restrictions if on ground floor (L5)
*CBD-C: Yes
*CBD-X: Yes
*CBD-P/CH: Yes
*RM: No
*RU-1 to RU-3: No.
*RU-4: Yes, but only non-residential buildings built before April 2011.
*RU-5: Yes, but only non-residential buildings built before April 2011.


=== L4 ===
With the exception of parcels facing Broadway, Telegraph Avenue, and 14th Street, the total floor
area devoted to these activities on the ground floor by any single establishment may only exceed 7,500
square feet upon the granting of a conditional use permit

=== L5 ===
If located both on the ground floor of a building and within 30 feet from any street-abutting property
line, these activities are only permitted upon the granting of a conditional use permit...(more text in planning code).

=== L7 ===
These activities may only be located on or below the ground floor of a building with some exceptions (explained in planning code).</text>

=== What is Sudoroom? ===

We are a hackerspace in Oakland, California.

=== What's a hackerspace? ===

Watch this KQED Video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wamwklXWK4M Open Source Creativity: Hackerspaces]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It's not easy to say what a hackerspace is exactly. You know it when you're in one, but they're all unique because people are so unique.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;—Mitch Altman of [https://www.noisebridge.net/ Noisebridge]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== What does &quot;sudo&quot; mean? ===

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudo Sudo] is a software command that stands for &quot;super user do&quot;. It's pronounced &quot;sue-dough&quot; or &quot;sue-due&quot;.

=== Who can go there? ===

Sudoroom is currently only open to members and guests. In a few months (fall 2014) we hope to be open to the public again. Please contact us if you'd like to be a guest. :)

We have quiet hours from 10pm-10am.

Soon our new space will have a phone number that you can call.

We are wheelchair accessible.

Young children need to be supervised by a guardian. We don't have childcare available. Sorry!

=== Can I have an event there? ===

Maybe! We love events like these:
* For a good cause
* Local, community-based
* Disability accessible
* Free, sliding scale, pay what you can, donation-based, nobody turned away

We don't like events like these:
* Pay-walled
* Socially oppressive
* Corporate or military sponsored

To make an event:
* If you are a member - use do-ocracy:
**Check the [https://sudoroom.org/calendar/ calendar] for conflicts
**Create a [https://sudoroom.org/wp-login.php?action=register Wordpress account]
**[https://sudoroom.org/wp-admin/post-new.php?post_type=ai1ec_event Add] your event
* If you are not a member:
** If you anticipate any problems, reach out to the [https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/sudo-discuss mailing list] or to [mailto:info@sudoroom.org info@sudoroom.org].
** Get approval by sudoers. A good way to do this is at one of our [https://sudoroom.org/ai1ec_event/weekly-meetup-2/ weekly general meetings]. Showing up in person is preferred. But if you can't make it you can ask for the action to happen over the sudo-discuss mailing list (as linked above), and maybe you can get approval over email.

We can promote your event on our [https://sudoroom.org/blog blog], [https://twitter.com/sudoroom twitter], etc. Just ask!

=== How do I become a member? ===

# Introduce yourself in person or on the [https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/sudo-discuss mailing list] or at a meeting
# [[Gittip|Pay some dues]] or do some work like cleaning, etc
# Create a wiki user page or email some contact info to [mailto:info@sudoroom.org info@sudoroom.org]
# Wait a short while
# '''''Poof!''''' You're a member!

Existing members can block you if they know you to be a violent, malicious or otherwise problematic person, but this is rare.

=== What does membership mean? ===

If you are a member then you can participate in our consensus decision-making procedure&amp;mdash;the way sudo room acts. 

It also means you can have your own access code, which means you can let yourself into the space.

=== What's your legal structure? ===

It's still evolving. Here's some history:
* In November 2011, Sudoroom held its [[First_Meeting|first meeting]]. We've held [[Meetings|regular meetings]] ever since then.
* In early 2012, we agreed to an [[Articles_of_Association|Articles of Association]].
* In late 2013, we filed [[Articles_of_Incorporation|Articles of Incorporation]] with the state of California, and elected a [[Board|Board of Directors]]

=== Can I store X at sudoroom ===

You can put a useful tool or some hacker ore neatly at sudoroom. Once you put something out at sudo and unless it says &quot;do not hack on it&quot; (and even then) there is no guarantee as to what will happen. You can however also rent a locker at sudo if you need private space, it is $25 per month.

=== When is sudo room open? ===

Sudo room doesn't have official hours. If you are a member you can get 24-hour access to let yourself in. If you are not a member, you will have to depend on at least one other member being there to let you in, and you would be their guest.

Typically there people at sudo room from 11am to 2am (or later 4am) most days of the week - but no guarantees.

Soon we will have a phone number you can call.

=== Can you fix my iPhone/iPad/Android Phone/Tablet/Laptop/other Device? ===

Complicated. Sudo room does not offer fix-it services. You can come to sudo room, use all our tools, and ask for help in fixing it yourself. Maybe a nice sudoer - and there are some nice sudoers - will help point you in the right direction or explain something that that youtube DIY fixing video didn't go over. If you want to find someone that might be able to help online you can contact the [https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/sudo-discuss high-traffic mailing list]. In general there are no guarantees, but if you are dedicated you can learn to fix your own iBad.

=== Can you help me with Software Problem X? ===
Basically this is the same question as [[#Can you fix my iPhone/iPad/Android Phone/Tablet/Laptop/other Device?]]. Maybe, you'll have to find someone willing to help, which is possible, maybe on the mailing lists or IRC.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5603">The FauxTurkeyBrew is a home beer-brewing system based around the cheap used turkey fryers available in the U.S. 

The goal is to make a guide for how to build a home beer-brewing setup, while optimizing for the following properties.

* ~ $200 - $300 total materials cost.
* All grain brewing.
* At least 25 liter batch brewing capacity.
* Intentioned for outside brewing.
* Minimize total brew time
* Minimize amount of time human attention is needed during brew.
* Ensure food safety of all materials contacting brew.
** Mash does not contact open air after boil.
* Keep grain, yeast and hops cost as low as possible.

= version 0.1 =

This is the current version.

*Mash tun: [http://www.bayouclassicstore.com/Turkey%20Fryers/1118.html Bayou Classic 32 Qt. Stainless Steel Turkey Fryer] - ~$60 used
:People often buy these and use them once or never. I found mine for $60 on craigslist. There is also a cheaper and slightly smaller aluminum version.
*Grain bag: [http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/00200693/ IKEA Ursula unbleached cushion cover] - $12.00
:This grain bag is sturdy, made of 100% unbleached [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramie ramie], and has withstood about 10 brews so far with no noticeable wear. It fits a turkey fryer perfectly, and includes straps that can be used to tie secure it around the top of the mash tun.
*Mash cooler: A home-made Counter-flow chiller using copper pipe inside garden hose - ~ $60
*Heating: This setup uses the gas burner included with the turkey fryer.
*Propane tank: I forget what the propane tank deposit is.
*&quot;No-weld&quot; spigot for mash tun - $? (need to find price and components for this)

== Tools required ==

* Copper solder equipment
* Hole-cutting bits and drill (for fermenter)
* Something to cut

== Counter-flow chiller ==

[http://fieldsbrewing.blogspot.com/2012/01/counterflow-chiller.html Here's the guide I more or less followed]. Note that you don't need any kind of special high-temperature rubber hose. Normal garden hose will do just fine (I used it for many brews). You could potentially worry about food safety, but there is a copper tube between the beer and hose, and water is flowing constantly so the temperature will never go above what the garden hose is rated for. Many people use longer copper tubes, but if you gravity feed the tube, then 10 feet is _plenty_ for cooling your mash from boiling. I recommend getting a longer hose though (e.g. 25 feet), since you can use the extra length to connect to the faucet without having to buy an extender hose.

*[http://www.homedepot.com/p/Unbranded-3-8-in-x-10-ft-Copper-Soft-Refrigeration-Coil-PCLE-375R010/203654362 10 feet 3/8 inch soft copper tube] - $13
*[http://www.homedepot.com/p/Neverkink-5-8-in-x-25-ft-Heavy-Duty-Water-Hose-8605-25/100661323 25 feet 5/8 inch garden hose] - $16
*Two 1/2&quot; to 1/4&quot; copper reducers - ~ $8 total
*Two 1/2&quot; copper tees - ~ $2.50 total
*[http://www.homedepot.com/p/Mueller-Streamline-1-2-in-x-2-ft-Copper-Type-M-Pipe-MH04002/100553697 Some length of 1/2&quot; copper pipe] - ~ $5
*Four hose clamps - ~ $4 total
*Some large zip ties - ~ $2
*KY Jelly (for getting the copper tube through the hose) - ~ $3
*Borrowing someone's copper soldering gear - ~ $5

=== Future improvements ===

It'd be nice if this could be done with a few more hose clamps and no copper soldering. Need to do more research.

== Problems ==

When heating the grain to 72 degrees C, the heating from below with the grain bag seated in the false bottom can easily cause the bottom and sides to get to boiling, causing the mash to boil over and deactivating the enzymes. This can be solved by a combination of using less grain and stirring the mash manually. Automatic circulation of the mash during heating will be the major improvement of version 0.2

= version 0.2 =

Planned improvements:

*Circulation pump for mash during mashing
:I'm researching how to make a cheap high-flow peristaltic pump without specialty tools.
*Yeast archiving and re-use
:Yeast archiving seems to need pressure cooker and centrifuge. Re-use is vastly improved with a magnetic stirrer plate. Researching cheaper alternatives and build-it-yourself versions.

= version 0.3 =

Planned improvements:

*Grow your own hops
:My first attempt failed. Need to read up on optimal hops growing conditions.
*Super cheap build-it-yourself grain grinder
:Looking for sources for cheap knurled stainless steel cylinders. So far found the &quot;footrests&quot; for BMX bikes. More research needed.
*Roast your own specialty malts.

= version 1.0 =

Planned improvements:

*Replace propane burner with home-built rocket stove thus getting rid of propane expense/dependency. 

For this version of the brew setup the only supplies you ever have to buy are:

*Malted barley
*Water
*A bit of wood
*Electricity for yeast storage

= version 2.0 =

Malted barley is more expensive than normal barley. Doing the malting yourself is problematic because of the drying step. Is it possible to malt the grain, then grind and use it while wet? The malting itself is simply a matter of wetting the barley and storing it at the right temperature for a while.

For this version of the brew setup the only supplies you ever have to buy are:

*Barley
*Water
*A bit of wood
*Electricity for yeast storage

= version 3.0 =

Improvements:

*Ultra-efficient solar-powered freezer
*Grow your own wood 
:E.g. willow trees growing on the nutrients from your composting toilet that you probably have.
*Solar water still
*Barley farming operation

For this version of the brew setup the only supplies you ever have to buy are:

Our active projects include making small batches of Kombucha and building a temperature monitor using a Raspberry PI. Got other ideas? Bring 'em by! 

We are working out of &quot;Room 1&quot; on the CCL side of the Bocce Room shared by Sudo Room and CCL. When you enter the building from the door at the corner of Shattuck and 48th, you will enter into a room that was formerly a bar and has mirrored walls on one side. Walk to the end of the room through the open door, and make a left. You have arrived! :D 

==Weekly updates==
===July 21st, 2014===
*Discovered both batches of Kombucha were contaminated..wah wah. We'll figure out a better system for next time! 
*Connected monitoring component with Raspberry PI.

===July 14th, 2014===
*Made two small batches of Kombucha.
*Discussed Raspberry PI while waiting for components to arrive.

===July 7th, 2014===
*1st meeting and planning.
*Agreed to bring supplies for Kombucha to next meeting.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2582">There is a file server on [[Space_Server|space.local]].

It is 650 GB on an external USB harddrive and completely read/writable to anyone in the space.

= Access using SFTP = 

== Ubuntu ==

Open the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_%28file_manager%29 file manager] and in the top menu (all the way at the top of the screen) choose &quot;File -&gt; Connect to Server&quot;. Fill out the dialogue box like so:

*Service type: SSH
*Server: space.local
*Folder: data
*User Name: sudoer

You can choose to add a bookmark so you don't have to fill out the dialogue every time. 

The password is: sudoer

== Mac OS X ==

You don't need to download any programs. Just go to your finder, scroll down to the shared area and you'll see space.
Login as a guest, no password needed.

[[File:Space.local on a Mac.png|On a mactinosh just click on finder and then you have access to space.local]]

=== FTP from a Mac ===

You can use the free [http://cyberduck.ch/ Cyberduck] program.

*Server: space.local
*Username: sudoer
*Password: sudoer

== Windows ==

On Windows, it's probably easier to use Windows filesharing (see below). If you for some reason prefer SFTP, you can use the free/open [http://winscp.net/ WinSCP] software.

*Server: space.local
*Username: sudoer
*Password: sudoer

= Access using SMB/CIFS (Windows filesharing) =

WE SWITCHED SERVERS! Some of this information maybe inaccurate, but the information for Lubuntu has been verified.

== Ubuntu (Nautilus file manager) ==

In the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_%28file_manager%29 file manager], make sure the side pane is open (if not, hit F9 to toggle the side pane). Click &quot;Network&quot; in the side pane, then &quot;Windows Network&quot;, then &quot;Workgroup&quot;, then &quot;SPACE&quot; and finally &quot;sudoshare on 192.168.42.1&quot;. You can now browse the available data and upload new data by dragging the files to the window.

== Lubuntu (PCMan file manager) ==

In the file manager address field, enter:

  smb://192.168.42.1/

Wait. It might take a while and it will seem like nothing is happening. Once the icons show up, double-click the sudoshare folder.

==Windows General==
[[File:Files server screeenshot.PNG|thumb|300px]]
Go to start -&gt; run. In that box write &quot;\\SPACE&quot;. You should see a folder. The default username/password ''guest/guest'' give you read and write access.

== Windows XP ==

Just go to &quot;My Network Places&quot; and &quot;sudoroom public data on space server&quot;. You can now browse the available data and upload new data by dragging the files to the window.

If it asks for a username and password, they're both &quot;guest&quot; (without the quotes).</text>

*Matt Senate
*Marc Juul

==Notes==
*Possible strategy: find user groups to call the space home, connect to orgs or groups who want to put on pre-fab'd workshops.
*Get a room, people will flock in.
*Principles (options: &quot;Be excellent to each other&quot; and &quot;No new rules&quot;), but also guidelines (e.g. safe space)
*Situate the group in terms of hacker culture and hacker ethic (history and education opportunity)
*Build &quot;Systems&quot; not rules or policies.

*There are sometimes trouble with personal items, but there are a lot of &quot;service design&quot; and automation opportunities through Labitat's projects to set up food purchasing, item/tool tracking with QRcodes and symbols, and member registration and access with magnetic stripped IDs.
**On that note, The Noun Project should make hacker-space icons, but they have a lot of stuff already: http://thenounproject.com/
*Need to read &quot;Hacker Spaces Patterns&quot; document, outlining how to set up a new hacker space, or at least how others have done it.

*Need to sort out the fiscal sponsorship asap, especially for bank account, property lease, and grant application purposes. (Open Science, Cooperative, and Collective &quot;incubator&quot; opportunities)
**Goal here is to set up hierarchy only for business purposes, but help make the hacker space more lateral.
*Create list of grants with deadlines on a simple calendar
*Also need an event calendar for momentum-building.

==Action Items==
*Meet [[Sudo_room/First_Wed_Meetup|in 2 weeks on Wednesday November 30th at 7pm]] (location TBD), and hold a weekly meeting every subsequent week. Provide food.
*Get a space asap (do what's necessary to make that happen).
*Make commitment to public access by holding &quot;public open&quot; sessions in the evenings.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1307">First Response Oakland is a grassroots initiative to cultivate a network of coordinated response and aid for emergency and disaster preparedness. To this end, we seek to:
*learn essential skills for how to protect yourself and your community in the event of an emergency (earthquake, tsunami, fire, paramilitary attacks, etc;)
*build human and communications infrastructure
*map local resources and skilled professionals
*create evacuation plans
*build home emergency kits and mobile kits (in the case of immediate evacuation)

Our first event will be a CORE I training on February 21st, outlined here: http://www2.oaklandnet.com/Government/o/OFD/s/CORE/OAK026258

Food hacking at Sudo Room

'''Carbonated Mate Drinks'''

We are on the way to making more ecological, less wasteful, less sugary, and overall healthier versions of soda and &quot;energy drinks&quot; at SudoRoom.

* Max has this incredible idea... I'm letting him run with it!
* Romy can bring her own SodaStream from home to make carbonated water.  Later we can find ways to buy cheap co2 cannisters and make soda without using proprietary products.

==[[Sudomate]]==

We don't need no proprietary carbonation
we don't need no energy drink monopolization
we don't need no high fructose corn syrup
we just need some sudomate to rip rip rip

Recipe for '''Sudo Mate Mach 5'''&lt;br&gt;
280 g sugar liquid &amp; lightly caramelized&lt;br&gt;
80g of Mate thrown into the hot sugar. Stir to mix all mate into liquid sugar&lt;br&gt;
4 Liters of hot water to disolve the sugar and steep the mate. Steep 5 minutes.&lt;br&gt;
Add&lt;br&gt;
4 pinches of salt&lt;br&gt;
25g vanilla xtract&lt;br&gt;
30g ginger sliced fine&lt;br&gt;
50g honey&lt;br&gt;
40g lemon juice (bout a lemons worth)&lt;br&gt;
40g lime juice (bout 2 limes)&lt;br&gt;
and 2 pinches of guar gum&lt;br&gt;
mixxx&lt;br&gt;
yield is apprx 4 Liters

== [[Sudoshroom]] ==

Mycology experiments for fun, heath, and saving the world! 


== Raymond Lai's Food Hacking ==


I don't even know where to start! This man is amazing.
We will add more about Ray's food experiments, many of which are interwoven with personal family stories.
You will find a lot of food experiences at our weekly Wednesday meetings!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1955">What does it mean to fork sudo room?

==Images==
&lt;gallery mode=&quot;compact&quot;&gt;

File:Sudofork simplified logo.svg|sudo fork logo simplified (.svg)
File:Sudofork simplified logo raster.png|sudo fork logo simplified (.png)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Decentralization==

There is no clear answer, but ''decentralization'' affords many things, like ''resilience'' and ''parallelization'', which remains consistent with a [[Articles of Association#Section 2.0 Definition|horizontalist structure]].

==Forking Paradox==

From the world of corporate open source software, consider these &quot;anti-patterns&quot; described by [https://gist.github.com/wrought/7030146 Bryan Cantrill]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''Forkaphobia:'''

Fear of folks taking the software, forking, and dividing up the community. But, there is a forking paradox that the easier a software is to fork, the more difficult it is to fork the community. Good experimentation happens with easy forks, safely downstream. When forking is difficult, only dissenters (few) bother to fork.

Sub-Anti-Pattern: '''Governance orgy''' (from Forkaphobia)

Difficult forking, especially exacerbated by forkaphobia, breeds focus on governance and formalism. This wastes times and encourages the formation of factions (thus winners, losers, politics, etc).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This paradox is really interesting applied to our case:
:''The easier a hackerspace is to fork, the more difficult it is to fork the community.''

==Solidarity==

Perhaps what decentralization, the forking paradox, and forkaphobia may suggest about hackerspaces is that there is a great value and opportunity in making forking easy, and encouraging forking as experimentation and an opportunity for resilience, '''as long as a sense of solidarity can remain between forks'''. In principle, this should be possible with good-faith forks, both experimental and in (moral) dissent.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4575">This is creating this page, for the future. Can be exported to other wikis, also. I am looking at http://howtopedia.org as a place to compile a lot of these technologies and materials, how-to's, etc. But the most productive system is anarchy. :)

Feel free to edit if you wish.

===Catalogs===
http://tinyurl[dot]com/nongmoseed&lt;br /&gt;
For fruit trees, now enjoying this catalog from 4 Season Nurseries: http://www.4seasonsnurseries.com/detailview.asp?page=1&lt;br /&gt;
Seeds- just do them. Online ordering like this, or a seed library, or what you've harvested and seed-saved from the past.
This person did out their seed ordering list on a blog like a confession: http://awaytogarden.com/the-confession-what-seeds-i-ordered/

Will you have non-vegan elements in your garden? If you eat chicken, or eggs; or like to use milk products like milk, butter, ice cream, coffee cream, etc, then you can use a post-hole digger and sheep and goat fence is like, $45 for 150 feet? The number one mistake that people make when going into this field is spending too much on fence. You could use or find some portable electric fence mesh netting, or a single, double, triple, or 5-line system, which shocks them on the nose if they go there, so even sheep just learn like, within 2 minutes. Sheep respect a fence, and like the comfort of wood. Goats will try to get to where they want to, over the fence if they can! I got a great picture of chickens inside a small night-time container around here. That seems like a pretty good way to have them at night, and they will help till, lay eggs every day, and give themselves as meat occasionally also. Chickens and goat can be kept in small area. Browse craigslist for them.

===Maps===
Gardening don't be a colonizer. Instead of looking at squares which focus on property lines, look at nature. 
What is the areas that are grass, and things that are already there. Shady, and taller patches. Where are the bugs gathering currently, and what does that mean? What could fit in there nicely, and you want to provide all your food from your yard or area in a short time. It's good to think of access ways, which paths you would like to keep open and how you enter most often, you could even look at footprints. What's there already, also this will make nature more vivid and strong :) 

It's best to not try to &quot;place&quot; things on the map that aren't there yet. This is usually the last design step in permaculture planning. Why, is simply that looking at all of the other aspects and considering these elements and what you want to eat, really affects the outcome of how the garden looks. You can still grow what's in your fridge currently, if you take a little while longer in the planning. Go with.&lt;br /&gt;

===Tools required===
A shovel will help greatly in what you need to do. Other hand tools, of choice!&lt;br /&gt;
Wheelbarrow for moving heavy stuff, light stuff, storing stuff, and putting weeds into to make the compost pile.&lt;br /&gt;
I find the most inspirational basic thing to have access to is two or so large plastic tubs, and/or buckets. Simplifies.&lt;br /&gt;
Amend with sand if clay-y, soil compost, chop, water, goat, worm, and rabbit manure can be used instantly, chicken or sheep or cow compost it first, horse after one year, human after two years. &lt;br /&gt;
Recycled materials for starting your seedlings, this is best.&lt;br /&gt; 
For indoor or cold-weather areas, those plastic sheets are very good.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally, if doing biochar then you will want a tin can with another top from a larger tin can. This goes into the fire and lets you use charged sticks as your wonderful soil fertilizer and spirit.&lt;br /&gt;

Transportation: Bike, or, always a thing.

Cell Phone: Free from a payment plan: https://www.safelinkwireless.com/Enrollment/Safelink/en/Public/NewHome.html
Free from government surveillance: Metro PCS. You don't even have to, give them a name....

Rent/Land, best* answer: &quot;Where there is no greed, there is no struggle for ownership. Also, when everything is free, no-one needs to covet your property when they can just as easily get their own. In a free world, people will also respect each other's entitlement to safe dwelling, privacy and security, because that's how they will be taught from the earliest age - about communities, nature and how we're all connected and mutually dependent.&quot; http://www.freeworldcharter.org/en/faqs

Food: An important one, many hacks. See designs, uploaded on a food page here. 
In the meantime, makes sens to have folks eat @ community meals which are cooked every day, already well funded + staffed voluntarily or: second-harvested, eg we would be at a farm. but: you don't want food production to be centralized so repurpose waste and find and harvest and trade and barter seeds :)

On a societal level: We can do away with the notion of haves and have-nots. We could unleash our full technological potential: &quot;allow us to tap into alternative energy technologies, just imagine food produced to the highest standards with plentiful supply. Bigger and better hospitals and schools, with no budget problems. Meaningful knowledge and prosperity to all over the world. Clean energy and communications available to everyone. Space exploration. Underwater cities, who knows? Take away costs, and the only limits are our imagination, and the raw materials to make whatever we want.&quot; The Free World Charter.
  
Real: dog food (free in Berkeley), coffee (could use a, lobby somewhere LOL), cheat. Peanut butter, tobacco, and coffee pretty high up there (FOR ME, EC.)

Is the United States ready for Universal Human Rights? Designed at: http://www.yesmagazine.org/issues/is-the-u.s.-ready-for-human-rights/the-universal-declaration-of-human-rights
The Constitution: Bill of Rights text. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights

One thing occupy really touched on is freedom of common areas, spaces. Local, state, city, and national land can be freed at all levels to really provide for the public good and learn new ways to co-exist with our environment rather than slashing it down for mono-cultured crops. One really positive public example is in the city of Seattle, where they allocated area for a food forest, which anyone can freely go and plant, tend, harvest, learn, walk through, etc.

Another thing is that this generation is going to be upset about all the debt we are saddled with. Especially when, the Wall Street and Fed Reserve bankers have been printing money and inflating the bubble despite massive civil unrest for now more than two years. How is the future going to contend with all that the country is fucking up now? Justice, to me means we are ready for a crash as things are called out....

= Donations =

Monthly member donations vary between about $1 and $80. The total income from these donations have generally been enough to pay for rent and utilities. At times we have supplemented with donations from fundraising parties held at sudo room.

= Grants 2013 =

On September 19, 2013, Sudo Room applied for a $5,000 Alternative Exposure grant from Southern Exposure, a nonprofit artistic resource center based in the Mission District of San Francisco. On November 5th, we were delighted to learn we'd won (along with a dozen other self-organizing organizations supporting the artistic community) $4700. The application will soon make its way to the wiki, and currently can be viewed at [https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4_Q7DQvNFT-Sk1NOWROUldWX0E&amp;usp=sharing this Google Doc folder]. *UPDATE* Reward letter now included in the Google Doc folder.</text>

This is a project list we've discussed throughout our May 2013 Meetings

'''Please add your name next to projects you're working on or would like to work on. If you have an idea that's not listed, please add it in!'''

==Food==
* Sudo Mate - ''Max &amp; Ray &amp; Morten''
** Iced, carbonated, DELICIOUS mate soda beverage (exquisite, yum!)
* Sudo Beer (Subiir) - ''Morten &amp; Marc''
* Sudo Gravy (marinara sauce) - ''Ray'' - Last week's $40 went to Sudo Room rent. Sold all 4 pints (all that was left after dinner) Yay!
* Sudo Lunch / Grab-n-go option - ''?'' [DOES NOT YET EXIST]
* Rusty's &quot;Savior Bars&quot; - ''Rusty''
* Eddie's &quot;Dope&quot; Popcorn - ''Eddie''
===Cottage Food Law===
In January, 2013, the State of California passed our very own Cottage Food Law. This law allows the existence of food operations out of one's home after a kitchen inspection, a short food handling course and the payment of processing fees. Acceptable food items are basically anything with a long shelf life and no meat. 

On a related note, we could potentially form a cottage food producers' cooperative and save on the processing fees.

==Fellowships==


==Most Important things for a Project==
# Pitch video
#* Depends on what you're doing, but it needs to be clean. 
#* &quot;Cool&quot; cause buzz, maybe viral marketing. Present images of the kind of thing going on. 
#** We host events, doing things that would show up in the space.
# Media ready, e.g. photos, logos, external website, social media, press release, blog roll.
#* Work the connections, reddit, techcrunch, boingboing, gizmodo. 
# Setting a goal, and an accurate budget. More about being clear.
#* If you reach your goal, you're likely to exceed it 31%, shoot a bit lower!
# People need to like your cause, they can be involved and feel like they supported something substantial.
# Need some seeders, even encouraged!
# Gauge your goals based on your network, and how big it is.
#* Build heuristics for how much you can get (e.g. $40 / person).
#* Average is $75
# Need to have good perks (read ideas below)
#* $25, $100 are the most important price points, in that order. 
# Keep posting media after campaign launches --&gt; you earn 81% more money!
# If you're working with a team, you raise 80% more money.

===Perk Ideas===
* Sponsor a square-foot-month (actually write their names on the square feet)!
** e.g. $25 gets you a 1 sq. ft. for 6 mo.
* Groups using the space for meetings, a big amount!

===Links===

* http://kickstarter.com/
* http://indiegogo.com/

==Fundraising==

The main concept here is to get the word out, publicize, find opportunities for major support, while also bringing in a bit of money for the space. Should be fun, fairly easy, valuable to supporters and above all: do-able.

===Item Ideas===
* Some useful little gadget
* Stickers
** &quot;Hacking is Not a Crime&quot;
** &quot;This Machine Kills Fascists&quot;
** Official seal / support sticker (e.g. like &quot;police support&quot; stickers that get you out of traffic tickets)

===Service Ideas===
* Some sort of web hosting / application service.
* Something cute like a &quot;free consultation&quot;
* Personalize services to a range of skills members have.

==Other==

* General Business Development notes from Len
    * from a business standpoint there are two different funding mechanisms at play here: one is internal funding, the other is coming from external sources. You can also look at things as &quot;products&quot; or &quot;not products&quot; the technology may or may not be there. Examine the who / what / where / when / why, and the time / effort involved. examining this will rule most of the options in the brainstorm out.</text>

The Apple G4 Cube Speakers have the following annoyances that this page seeks to remedy:

*They will not function on most computers (except for headphone output)
*They draw more power than most computers can supply over USB.
*There is no analog input.

Leave it to Apple to fuck up something as simple as a set of stereo usb speakers.

This page describes a series of hacks to fix these problems.

= Making them work on all computers =

The fact that only the headphone output works on most computers is actually a driver problem, not a power problem as some forum posts may lead you to believe. For some Mac OSX versions, this can apparently be fixed by installing an older version of the Audio driver.

It is likely an energy-saving measure, since the amplifier draws quite a bit of power.

The fix is fairly simple. 

The little usb audio adapter / amplifier box has two main chips:

*One Tripath TA1101B
:This is the digital audio amplifier that is hooked up to the speakers.
*One Micronas UAC3552A 
:This is basically a single-chip USB audio adapter.

The datasheet for the Tripath chip has the following to say about pin 11:

''MUTE: When set to logic high, both amplifiers are muted and in idle mode. When low
(grounded), both amplifiers are fully operational. If left floating, the device stays in
the mute mode. Ground if not used. ''

This pin is likely being toggled by the Micronas chip, based on input from USB.

We can simply disconnect pin 11 from the circuit board by gently lifting/prying it off with a small screwdriver (gently! don't break it!), then soldering a wire from pin 11 to any place on the board with +5 volts. +5 volts is available from a bunch of locations, including pins 3 and 8 on the Tripath chip (more difficult to solder) and the point of contact of the thick black wire with a red stripe coming from the USB cable (easy to solder).

[[File:G4 cube speaker lifted pin.jpg|thumb|Lifted mute pin soldered to a wire.]]

[[File:G4 cube speaker lifted pin side.jpg|thumb|Lifted mute pin side view]]

[[File:G4 cube speaker ground wire.jpg|thumb|Other end of mute pin wire soldered to ground.]]

Now the amplifier will never be muted and your speakers should work on any modern GNU/Linux, Mac OSX or Windows computer, without installing any special drivers.

= Other possible hacks =

== More power ==

The G4 Cube speakers need more power than a normal computer can supply over USB in order to function optimally (and not be very very quiet).

Normal USB2 ports can supply up to 2.5 watts, and USB3 ports can supply up to 4.5 watts. The amplifier in the G4 Cube speakers needs about 20 watts.

So-called USB charging ports can deliver up to 25 watts. These are sometimes referred to as USB+ and will often remain powered when the computer is in standby mode.

Apparently special high-powered USB3 ports will be able to supply up to 100 watts, according to the [http://www.usb.org/press/USB_Power_Delivery_Spec_Completion_FINAL.pdf USB power delivery specification], but I haven't seen any devices with support for this yet.

Currently, more power can be supplied in the following ways:

*Through a built in high-powered USB port
:The G4 Cube has them. I have been told that some other Macs have them, but I don't know which.
*Through a USB charging port
:Similar to the G4 Cube port, but standardized and only available in newer computers.
*By using a powered USB hub.
:Some (most?) of these can deliver enough power.
*By connecting (soldering) an external 5 volt power supply to the G4 Cube speaker's citcuit board.

The last one is actually fairly simple. Simply cut the black wire and red-striped wire coming from the USB cable and insulate the USB-cable ends so they don't end up touching each other or anything else (it's a good idea not to cut both wires at the same point). Then solder a connector or power 5v DC power adapter directly onto the two little bits of remaining wire sticking out of the board (make sure + goes to the red-striped one). 

== Analog amplifier ==

The Micronas chip has the ability to amplify an analog signal, 
meaning that it could be used as a general-purpose amplifier for e.g.
a portable mp3 player, while still being powered over USB.

Micronas chip pin 33 (called AUXEN) should be set high to enable this feature,
and another minijack port should be soldered onto pin 36 (AUXL) and 37 (AUXL) of the Micronas chip.

Apparently minijack ports exist which include a built in switch that could then be wired up to AUXEN to automatically turn it on when a minijack is connected. AUXEN could also be set permanently high, but the board will never go into power save mode while AUXEN is high (and it draws quite a bit of power). A better solution might be to install a switch.

If there is both analog input and digital input (from USB) then the two signals will be mixed.

15:25 &lt;@Rab&gt; No small matter unfortunately, unless you get really imaginative on the CAM side and utilitize the robot's axes of movement in very simple ways.
15:27 &lt;@Rab&gt; I think it'll probably need to be somebody's brilliant custom CAM because open-sores CAM is pretty seriously limited, and more than 3-axis commercial CAM is insanely expensive.
15:28 &lt;@Rab&gt; PyCAM might be a start, that's what I'll use if I do anything 3D.
15:38 &lt;@Rab&gt; Autodesk Fusion 360 includes Autodesk's 3+2 CAM, which is probably the best and most usable CAM you'll find anywhere for zero dollars. But fuck that proprietary cloud shit.
15:42 &lt;@Rab&gt; CAM is one of those software applications which is so hard, anybody skilled enough to do it right also wants to get paid. That's a direct challenge to Sudo Room BTW.
15:45 &lt;@Rab&gt; You could join ##linuxcnc on feenode and see if anybody has any ideas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1132">Giant pandas are carnivores, but 99% of their food comes from more than 20 kinds of bamboos that grow in the high mountains and the deep valleys of China. With the changes of the seasons, the kinds of the bamboos and the diet of the giant pandas are different. They like bamboo shoots best. From spring to summer, they like to live on the bamboo shoots of the Qiong bamboo (Q.tunidinoda Hsueh et Yi), some bamboos of the madake bamboo category, the wood bamboos in Bashan, the walking stick bamboos, the Chaohua arrow bamboos (Fargesia scabrida Yi), the Huaxi arrow bamboos and the big arrow bamboos. The bamboo shoots are the new trunks of the bamboos that have no branches or leaves and grow from the underground bamboo roots. The bamboo is very small and tender, and the water content is abundant. The nutritional components include: the raw fat is 1.27%, the raw fiber is 33.62%, the crude protein is 10.32%, and the general quantity of sugar is 26.15%. The bamboo shoots are small and tender and they are succulent which taste good and therefore are easy to be digested and absorbed and they are dainty dishes for giant pandas.</text>

It's used by some [http://www.haproxy.org/they-use-it.html big sites]. Conveniently, if you need a [[reverse proxy]], you should also be able to use a [[load balancer]], and balance whenever you want as well.

==Reverse Proxy==

Here some samples of folks using HAproxy as a reverse proxy:

===IPv6===

It is also possible to use HAProxy as a reverse proxy for IPv6 clients as a buffer with IPv4 services (e.g. a webserver):

We want to sell all kinds of hackery things from a vending machine in our hacker space! 3D printed objects, usb sticks, mate straws (and mate), caffeinated snacks, arduinos, mesh routers, logic analyzers, lyophilized DNA (biohacking), dogecoins, ear plugs, headphones, batteries, etc! See the [http://hackpack.me hackpack project] for more inspiration.

[[File:IMG 1426.JPG|thumbnail|The black vending machine (a.k.a. vending1) is nearly ready to use (Mar. 2016)]]

There are currently two vending machines, one of which is ready to dispense product (as of March 2016).

Still needed:
* Product to dispense
* A lock for the door
* Something to direct the light from the fluorescent bulb so that it more clearly shows the product, rather than shining into the eyes of innocent bystanders
* A user interface
** some way to select a product
** a mechanism for providing payment
* A better place to put the trash and recycling bins that are currently blocking the front of the machine
* perhaps &quot;soup bowl&quot; coils for dispensing larger items like soylent packs https://snackattack.sharepoint.com/Pages/APSNACKMACHINEPARTS.aspx

[[File:Homer-vendingmachine.jpg|thumb|homer looking at OUR vending machine]]

= Funding =

The vending machine was initially funded by a sudo member stating on the mailing list that he wanted to get a vending machine, stating that they cost about $200, linking to one on craiglist, the member saying he'd put down $20 himself and asking if others would put down $20. After a few days, $120 of the cost had been covered and we figured the vending machine could cover the rest of its own cost going forward. The big robot arm was funded in the same way.

= Equipment =

== Bill of materals ==

This is incomplete since the project has not yet been completed.

*Vending machine: $150 via craigslist (+ gas to go get it)
**Model: Snackshop II  (this has been acquired)
*New bill acceptor: $49 via ebay
**Model: ICT BL-700-USD4.
**It accepts $1, $5, $10 and $20 and speaks pulse and serial
*Bill acceptor update chip for new $5 bills: $21 via ebay
*Beagle Bone Black: $65 via [https://www.adafruit.com/ adafruit]
*A cheap android tablet: $39 online from Fry's Electronics weekly promotions email
*Micro usb ethernet adapter: $3.35 [http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Fashional-new-arrival-High-Quality-White-5-Pin-Micro-USB-To-RJ45-LAN-Ethernet-Network-Adapter/1598794037.html aliexpress.com]
*USB magnetic stripe card reader: $20.50 from [http://www.dx.com/p/usb-universal-magnetic-stripe-credit-debit-card-bidirectional-swipe-reader-102283 dx.com] &lt;--- for what?
*Multiplexer and de-multiplexers and mosfets for button inputs and to control spiral rotation (for dispensing items): Unknown &lt;--- jake can implement this part for free

Total: ~$350

Prices include shipping and tax.

== Vending machine ==

We found a used Snackshop II vending machine on craigslist and offered $150. This is the kind of machine that has a bunch of metal spirals / huge corkscrews that hold the snacks. These types of machines are good because it's easy to put differently sized non-snack items in them and they're cheap. We're planning to replace its brain with a Beagle Bone Black.

[[File:Snackshop II.JPG|thumb|Snackshop II vending machine before being converted to the sudo room hack-o-mat]]

== Bill acceptor ==

The vending machine was working except for a broken bill acceptor and broken coin acceptor. They can likely be fixed but the bill acceptor only takes $1, $2 and $5 bills and doesn't take the new $5 bills. 

We bought:

A [http://www.ebay.com/itm/ICT-BL-700-USD4-US-Currency-Bill-Acceptor-Validator-used-/191139883132?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item2c80d3287c ICT BL-700-USD4] bill acceptor that takes $1, old $5, $10 and $20 bills for $49 including shipping and an [http://www.ebay.com/itm/ICT-700-BL-BILL-ACCEPTOR-UPDATE-FOR-NEW-5-THE-CHIP-TO-UPDATE-/221294809358?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item338632d10e updated chip] that allows for $21 that allows the bill acceptor to take the new $5 bills.

== Coin acceptor/dispenser ==

The built-in coin acceptor/dispenser does the following:

*Accepts 5c, 10c and 25c coins (broken)
*Sorts the incoming coins into the change dispenser (nearly working, easy to fix)
*Detects when there are too few or too many coins in the dispenser.
*Redirects coins when there are too many in the dispenser
*Dispenses 5c, 10c and 25c coins (nearly working, easy to fix)

The sorting mechanism needs to be modified so it always accepts what it gets, which should be as simple as locking the two solenoids in one position. The detection circuit needs more investigation and the nickel dispenser seems to be broken but we'll probably just control the solenoids directly anyway. Another option is to use a &quot;sorting coin bank&quot; and modify it for our needs. These are cheap at about $25 on ebay and include slots for dollar coins!

Since it looked unlikely that we'd be able to repair the acceptor part of the built-in acceptor/dispenser, we bought a coin acceptor [http://www.ebay.com/itm/250772291798?ssPageName=STRK:MEWNX:IT&amp;_trksid=p3984.m1497.l2649 for $28 including shipping on ebay]. Since that's an ebay link it may be gone when you read this, but it's the same as [https://www.adafruit.com/products/787 this one from adafruit] except that the one we got can be programmed to recognize up to five different types of coins. 

We will program it to accept these coins:

*1 cent (yesss!)
*5 cent
*10 cent
*25 cent
*1 dollar

We didn't just get a new acceptor/dispenser of the same general type because the cheap/old models are inflexible, only accepting nickels, dimes and quarters, and if you want support for $1 coins then the pricing seems to begin at $200 for a used model.

== $1 coin dispenser ==

Since we'll be accepting up to $20 bills, we will need better change than quarters. Unfortunately bill dispenser are expensive and you have to buy them used as ATM spare parts on ebay usually with little info on whether they're complete and functional. Another option is to buy a complete ATM of the type that doesn't support 3DES (now a requirement) or not compliant with the latest ADA regulations. We found two of non 3DES ATMs for $100 each on craigslist, and the bill dispenser could probably be hacked fairly easily (the rest of the electronics are likely encased in a large chunk of epoxy). However it was $100 and a two-hour drive both ways, just so we can dispense one type of bill.

Instead we could try 3D printing a dollar coin dispenser. It would be the same design as the built-in machine uses with a tube for the coins and a slot with a solenoid that pushes the bottom coin out the side of the tube on command. Should be pretty simple.

Another option is to use a motorized &quot;sorting coin bank&quot; from ebay and modify it to add solenoids and level detection.

== Bitcoin / altcoin acceptor ==

The vending machine will be networked and will monitor its bitcoin/altcoin addresses for incoming money. 

== sudo credit ==

Eventually your sudo room magnetic/rfid membership card + pin will allow you to buy stuff.

== Brain, display and selection ==

The original hardware was wired to use diodes on a board of switches, where the price was set for each product with five on/off switches, worth 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 cents.  The user would press a button for the product they wanted.  Since we don't want to use the buttons that way, we need to use triacs (electronic relays for AC) for each of the 40 product motors.  We are designing a custom circuitboard to replace the binary coin-counter matrix with 40 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing charlieplexed] triacs:

https://github.com/sudoroom/hackomat

which uses these triacs:

NOTE:  the beaglebone black GPIO pins are only rated for 4 to 6mA per pin, which means it is essential to choose a triac with a guaranteed trigger current of 5mA such as the MOC3023  If you instead get a part with a 15mA guaranteed trigger, you may end up with customers who don't get their product even though they paid for it, on days when the temperature or phase of the moon is wrong.  That would be really bad.

ALSO:  there are two physical versions of the through-hole part.  One is &quot;Dual-in-line&quot; and the other is &quot;Wide lead spacing&quot;.  The former fits in the sockets on this board, at standard DIP width of 0.300&quot; track width, while the &quot;Wide lead spacing&quot; would need to be bent to fit a normal socket, on this board.  You don't want to be stuck bending 240 pins for this project because you bought the wrong part, do you?

http://www.mouser.com/ds/2/239/MOC302-201763.pdf

their inputs are basically LEDs, and they're totally isolated from the AC output.  So we can charlieplex these 40 triacs to just seven GPIO pins from our controller, as long as it has three-state outputs.

We'll be using a $65 Beagle Bone Black for the brain and a $39 android tablet from Fry's electronics with a web app loaded from the Beagle Bone for display and selection. We're planning to have videos of sudoers presenting each item and headphones so people watch, listen and understand what they're bying. We'll probably still hook up the original dispenser buttons, but that's secondary.

One of the reasons for replacing the brain is that the original dispenser circuitboard has a max programmable price per item of $1.85, which conflicts with our desire to sell usb sticks out of the gum dispenser :) It will also make it easy for us to track how much money is spent on each type of item which means we can let other groups, like [https://counterculturelabs.org Counter Culture Labs] sell stuff out of our vending machine and track who should receive how much money without manually counting.

we can even allow purchases online to dispense locally, so you can call your parents and have them buy you a beaglebone black from New Hampshire and the vending machine will shit it out for you while you're on the phone with them.  Christmas is coming soon...</text>

How do we hack disability at SudoRoom? 

'''Organization of this Wiki'''
I'm dividing this into physical hacks, and disability activism. Some would argue that the personal is so political that there should be no divisions, but that stuff is way over my head. As an able-bodied person who is only temporarily disabled, I do not feel qualified to represent disabled people everywhere.  I'm probably already offending people with my semantics. - [[User:Romyilano|Romy]]

== Hacking Sight == 

How do you hack glasses so that you don't have to keep buying new ones every year? How do you recycle glasses? What are some cool ways to extend upon glasses (rear view mirrors, side mirrors) so that people wearing glasses see even more than people without glasses?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3358">In late May 2013, we find ourselves with a number of hacks necessary to improve ACCESS to &amp; functioning of the space. On Sunday 5/25/13, starting at 11:45 and running all day long (until the wee hours of Memorial Day Monday with a potential midnight tofu bbq), we will be HACKING THE ROOM.

Here are the necessary hacks (by category):

==Hardware Hacking:==
* Getting a raspi attached to the sudo &lt;=&gt; (common space) door. 
* Installing a circuit on both doors that will be able to send signals to their respective raspi's.
* Move shit and reorganize space. 

==Software Hacking:==
* DONE: Getting the mouse buzzer working
* Creating an API for the door open/closed states
* Whipping up some code for the homepage to interface with the API

==Administrative:==
* Getting a comprehensive membership list
** prerequisite: hack on different configurations of membership &amp; access (how do we determine who gets personal access to the space, etc.)? ...See the [[Articles_of_Association#Section_2.3_Benefits|&quot;member benefits&quot; section of the articles of association]] for details.
** Check out [[Membership Benefits Discussion]] to participate in the discussion over specific member benefits.
**(roadblock: Tommy needs access to the bank acct to get a list of dues paying members, no?)
** additional thoughts: what else is needed to improve membership management?
* Improving finance management
** Need to determine areas for improvement in the current finance tracking/management system and areas where responsibility can be shared, etc.
* Review clarifications required with landlords for space.
** STATUS: jenny sent the requirements for common space usage that we developed with the public space to george and asked for his list of requirements.
* Meeting format
** STATUS: Check out suggested reformatted version of meeting format at https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Sudo_room/Agenda_template and a live version here: https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroom . Please create divs and discuss this on the list.
* Outreach strategy
* Encouraging regular payment of dues from members
* Updating https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Door_Access


==Attendees:==

''Please add your name below if you plan to come to the hackathon and indicate which category of hack you'd like to work on and what times you'll be available (if you'll only be available for part of the day, this will help us coordinate to ensure that all the hardware hackers are present at the same time, etc.)''

* [[User:Mk30|mk30]] | admin &amp; food | all day &amp; night, except a few hours in the evening
* [[User:Legind|legind]] | software hacking | all day, maybe taking off in the evening
* [[User:Factotum|factotum]] | hardware+admin+coffee | from ~11 am to ~5pm
* [[User:Romyilano|Romyilano]] | Party mode Berkeley Skatepark invasion / setting up bitcoin donation page | Monday night aftermath (not there sunday or monday morning)
* [[User:Eddandotcom|eddanDotCom]] | sudo-opoly | early afternoon and late afternoon
* [[Special:Contributions/50.0.83.158|50.0.83.158]] 19:43, 29 May 2013 (PDT)

==Notes and Comments==

* Please note that the public school will have a poetry reading in the common space from 3-6PM, which means that we won't be able to use that space at that time and that we should strive to provide a quiet environment (ie, music should strive to not spill over into the common area).

Hacker dust is the small bits and pieces left over, laying around in a hackerspace, or wherever hacker activities exist.

Sometimes hacker dust has usable (even expensive) small pieces among useless scraps. Collecting hacker dusts in boxes and bins helps to sort and sift.

Hacker dust is magic dust.</text>

This page is dedicated toward workshops, experiments, and any other fascinating projects revolving around the idea of hacking sexual health, sex(uality) and gender. How you define these things is yours to develop and evolve. The greater intention of our hosting events around these topics is to bring them to the forefront and together discover how though our common creativity we can make Sudo Room a more sex-positive and gender-inclusive community.  
==Events==
[[image:Hacking Sexual Health.jpg|200px|left|Hard at work!]]
==='''''DIY Cloth Menstrual Pads Workshop'''''===
'''Saturday, May 4th, 2013: 2p-??''' 
NO EXPERIENCE OR ABILITY TO MENSTRUATE NECESSARY! Come learn how to make beautiful and practical cloth pads out of old clothing! Materials will be provided, but if you want, you can bring old ripped-up clothing (preferrably soft, natural fibers), needles, thread, snaps or buttons. This workshop is intended for people who menstruate and for people who have friends who menstruate (and want to make them lovely presents). 
We will also go over a dizzying array of cool lady products beyond the cloth pad, and have fun cost-comparisons of different options. 


==='''''[[2013 Bike Smut screening|Bike Smut screening]]'''''===
'''Friday, May 17th, 2013
&lt;br&gt;'''Sudo Room common room
&lt;br&gt;'''2141 Broadway
&lt;br&gt;'''Doors at 8:22, Screening at 9:07'''

Bike Smut asks for sex without shame and transportation without homogeny. It explores radical politics while remaining approachable and fun. Bike Smut believes in the importance of bringing communities together to redefine obscenity by creating a consensual space where different interpretations of obscenity can be watched and discussed. It is a joyous exploration into two integral parts of a quality human life. This was the final screening of Bike Smut's 6th year of programming, [[http://bikeporntour.blogspot.com/search/label/Turning%20Trixxx &quot;Turning TriXXX&quot;]]

===Interactive Pheromone Station===
Based off the old Exploratorium installation titled &quot;''The Olfaction of Attraction''&quot;, explorers had access to little squeeze bottles with human pheromones in them. Depending on one's genes and gender, one may find the smell either repulsive or attractive. It's fantastic seeing two people, one with a look of disgust and the other with a pleased smile, trying to reconcile their different perceptions.
===&quot;Quantified Sex&quot; Experiments===
Heart rate monitors, skin flushing, eeg, etc. 
*This relates to Ned and Maggie Mayhem of [http://psigasm.net/]: &quot;PSIgasm was conceived in 2010 by an HIV prevention specialist and an experimental physicist, both of whom moonlight as queer porn performers and are active in the Bay Area sex positive scene. The project revolves around measurement devices that can be used as sex toys, simultaneously getting people off and monitoring physiological responses correlated with arousal and orgasm.&quot; [[image:condom high fashion.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Let's start a high end condom fashion line!]]

==Inclusivity==
===Community Infrastructure===
How do we make the hackerspace a more inclusive space for people of all intersections of human sexuality? 

*'''Vicky is committed to making sure that women's and shared-gender bathrooms are fully stocked with menstrual products. She adds stuff on occasion from her bulk stockpile, but isn't always able to get to Sudo Room. Will you help her and add to the pile?''' 

*Let's create a sexual health box, including menstrual and safe sex products and information. Thinking in terms of the analog world and how people interact within it is really important! [[image:Condomerie Amsterdam.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Safe sex can be cute and funny and weird and colorful!]]

==Resources and People to Connect With==
* Good Vibes. OH WAIT, Vicky knows Joani Blank, the founder! 
* Feelmore 510 - gallery and sex shop, also run Fresh Fridays at The New Parkway (selection of films from the erotic, pornographic, thoughtful and beyond)
*FemSexComm/FemSex
*Arse Electronika 
*[http://slashdong.org/ Slashdong]: Kyle Machulis is a whip-smart brash software engineer who, on the side, blogs about teleldildonics (using haptic and telecommunications technology to facilitate long-distance sex), DIY sex toys, and other mash-ups of sex and tech. He's really fun.
*''The Archaeology of Vice''. Kari Jones and Liz Clevinger work in the archaeology programs at the Presidio of San Francisco. Among the things unearthed? Well, the archeological record suggests that, shockingly, soldiers stationed there liked sex, based on the wide range of vintage porn, prophylactics, and medically-dubious STD cures dug up in the Presidio.&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2755">Sudo Room is an open, non-hierarchical, collaborative community of humans, including tech developers, citizen scientists, activists, artists--and all combinations in between and beyond!--who are interested in and working towards social change. Our goal is to create the first inclusive, dedicated hackerspace in downtown Oakland, to share ideas and projects in citizen science, digital citizenship and literacy, environmental sustainability, community engagement, and self-government.

Sudo Room is committed to access, empowerment, transparency, and public/social good. Sudoers have a great diversity of interests and we emphasize respect and solidarity among ourselves and with others. 

Membership includes 24/7 access to the space with a personal access method, for example code and/or rfid.

    Unanimous consent

Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and have to leave when the last member leaves.

    Discussion, mostly vibe-y

To empower members to deal with problematic non-members, non-members can be thrown out at any time by a member if that members feels that the non-member is being a problem, _unless_ some other member present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member as a guest. Non-members being asked to leave must be told that they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list.

    Discussion: Some way of logging the incident? 

SYNHAK Akron:
We exist as a free public resource. If you have an idea that needs realized, it can happen at SYNHAK. 

Hackerspace Santa Barbara:
After having tools stolen by a guest, they made it so that a guest has to leave when the last member does for the night. I went with my sleeping bag down the street a ways. 

Would be even better if I had a [[Free materials, furnishings, resources, multimedia|treehouse]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5446">On 9 February 2013 [[user:Maximilianklein|your correspondent]] visited [http://oosm.org/ Hacklab Belgrade] with the intention of understanding sudo room in greater context. Here are some findings.

Hacklab Belgrade is relatively small in populace, area, and aspiration, but remarkably solid and cohesive in spite of - or because of - it's modest scope.

[[File:Hacklabbelgrade1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|900px|The entirety of tennis-court sized Hacklab Belgrade]]
Existing not in commercial space at all, but a donated first-floor apartment, Hacklab, if used for it's orginal intention, would be warming, showering, and dishwashing the everyday lives of at most 2 Serbian citizens. As it is, the living room and bedroom house the main hack area, which when I arrived was the combined chamber for 6 serbs attending the the weekly python workshop. In the middle of git-pushing their work and rearranging the furniture for that night's screening of the torrented &quot;The  Pirate Bay, Away From Keyboard,&quot; I managed to strike up a few interviews with the ragamuffins in exchange for some swigs of the 2.5L bottle of lager, and local wax-topped 'Rakija'. 

In no particular order: 

==Hacklab and gender-minority involvement==
[[File:Hacklabbelgrade0.jpg|left|thumb|center|500px|A cheap 3d printer printing an even cheaper bottle of &quot;Viniak&quot; brandy]]
Of the eight people that were at Hacklab before I arrived, three of them were women. Impressed by this minor imbalance I questioned one such female, Daria  (pictured above), if she could conjecture a reason. Yugoslavia, she answered. Communist and socialist Yugoslavia had strong feminism-activist lines and ideals. Inclusion was a theme that was taught and practised in aspects of everyday life of the multi-ethnic Yugoslavia, which of course predates Hackerspaces. Although Daria and the other Serbo-hackers lived only their infancy before the state divisions - fracturing arguably because of intolerance - she still insists that some perhaps nostalgic heritage lives on.
 
Arandjel, an ex-student-activist, was more skeptical to draw this link. He spun his phone on the table as Milosh, the reason why Serbia has the most active ''Wikinews'' of any language, theorized a connection between the hackerspace and the Yugoslavic tradition of socially-owned companies. Socially-owned companies were to Yugoslavian socialism as cooperatives are to capitalism, and enjoyed considerable success. A civil engineering firm run by anarcho-feminists became a vanguard example of what socially-owned companies could achieve, even granting their own internal diplomas that were later externally recognized. Such a genetic code, I commented, would be a fertile breeding ground for hackerspaces. Milosh answered yes, but that it wasn't until post-war Serbian salaries had increased to include a monthly fat of 1,000 dinar ($13) that a hackerspace became viable. This, Arandjel noted, would actually be an argument for a Yugoslavian mentality lending a predilection for self-organized communities, with the price of a few happy-meals being the only barrier to realization.

==Activity Speed==

Infamous experimental composer John Cage once wrote a solo organ piece entitled ''As Slow As Possible'' which contained no tempo marking to the musician, but only indicated that the composition should be played ''as slow as possible''. Whether or not a fan of Cage, Boyan, a hacker-organizer, tipped me onto the philosophy of how he ran his [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq Coq] class. The Hacklab Coq class, a mirror of the U Penn graduate course, is identical, except ran siiiiixxxx tiiiiiimmmmeeesss assssssssss slooooooooowwwwww. It's scheduled to take 50 weeks to complete, and there's no outside homework - everything is done in-space. The benefit of which Boyan exhorts is that no one is ever behind, and makes the course accessible to even the most time-stretched individuals.

If this sounds a bit like the slow-food philosophy, then the analogy is likewise complimented by the fact that Hacklab Belgrade keeps restaurant-like hours. The space has no locking mechanism except for the keys which are conservatively distributed. Access isn't a problem however because the space is operated on a [http://oosm.org/ weekly schedule] with known opening hours. This doesn't mean that there is never any free time - open hack is on Tuesdays. 

==Membership and Finance==
Hacklab Belgrade sidesteps the membership question with a simple decree: ''No membership.'' You turn up during the times that the calendar purports classes are or don't. In fact after the third weekly meeting in which the schedule was determined Hacklab Belgrade stopped meeting weekly since there was no further need in their eyes. Monthly meetings are still held, and Arandjel advocated for, and succeeded in adopting the Noisebridge consensus model for meetings. Vlad cheered their bent towards do-ocracy &quot;those who ''do'' have the ''advantage''&quot; he summarized.
As such the status quo rolls along sustainably at Hacklab. The most recent moment of crisis was winter when heating pushed their monthly budget from approximately $350 to $500. A call to the more flush members to kick in $26 instead of $13 will float them this year. However Milosh confided in me that if they had to pay the $250 in rent that is currently largessed by the hackerspace mother, Hacklab Belgrade wouldn't be able to exist.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11511">A hackpack is a backpack with a set of &quot;always carry&quot; tools for hacking the world around us.

We are starting a project at sudo room to create cheap base hackpacks with optional expansion packs.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The idea is that you get $1000 (pollination project, awesome foundation, donations). Once you have $1000 you buy 20 hackpacks at $50, have a series of workshops for 20 teenagers (e.g. in your hackerspace) where you teach hacking skills using the contents of the hackpack. After the end of the workshop series, everyone who made it to most of the sessions will take a hackpack home for free so they can continue hacking the world around them!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This page attempts to gather ideas for the contents of the hackpack, the curriculum for the workshops and complete source lists for hackpacks including where to buy everything to hit the $50 target.

We have a [https://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/hackpack mailing list] where we discuss everything related to hackpacks.

During the January 30th general meeting, [[User:Bleeblahblue|Vicky]] started a conversation on using hand signals during meetings as a way to rank speaker order and mark shifts between the topic at hand (*sad trombone*) and the conversation's meta-process. This page is for you, yes you, to refine and add to before submitting a formalesque proposal to the rest of Sudo Room! 
&lt;blockquote&gt;'''TWO IMPORTANT THINGS: 
#'''Make any revisions/proposals you'd like. 
#'''SIGN UP for future announcements in the &quot;Keep me informed!&quot; section!'''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
=='''Keep me informed!'''==
These here are people working on or generally interested the proposal. If the feeling's right, Vicky will organize a meet-up or email chain to help move the proposal forward.

=='''Concepts and Filosfeez'''==
*Yeah, man, like, order and not speaking over each other and shit. I am intrigued by the Occupy &quot;feelings&quot; signals, but am a bit wary that doing something like this in Sudo Room will make meetings painfully long. Do other people know of other concepts for bringing order to decision-making segments of group meetings/councils like ours? [[User:Bleeblahblue|Vicky]] ([[User talk:Bleeblahblue|talk]]) 04:48, 3 February 2013 (UTC)
*...
=='''Examples'''==
===Vicky's cooperative housing example===
The example I brought up were signals from my old consensus-run housing cooperative. Imagine the following symbols as being formed by hands. They are described in descending order of priority:

('''^''') '''Point of Process'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''The conversation is getting out of the facilitator's facilitation; An aspect of the [[Articles of Association]] is relevant to the conversation and should be mentioned; etc.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
('''!''' ) '''Point of Information'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''You know a fact about something and bring it up in order to clarify the conversation; etc.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
('''?''') '''Question'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Wait, what does that mean? Could you clarify what you mean? etc.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
('''=''') '''Direct Response'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''I have a comment that directly clarifies a comment, point of information or point of process, or answers a question.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
('''C''') '''Comment'''
&lt;blockquote&gt;''blah blah point of view or general comment.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
===Occupy example===
The file over yonder represents the typical signage used during Occupy. ---&gt;
[[File:Occupy hand signals.JPG|thumb|right|'''Note the &quot;Speaking&quot; vs &quot;Feeling&quot; duality!''']]

In the most effective General Assemblies that I've participated in, the most commonly used hand signals were:
*Twinkle fingers - For expressing support / agreement. At sudo room, we have already established a practice of snapping to express agreement, which is my personal preference :
*Wrap it Up - &quot;Wagon wheel&quot; with index fingers pointing toward each other, to indicate that the current speaker is taking too much time, reiterating the same point, and should generally try to wrap it up.
*Direct response - &quot;gun fingers&quot; to indicate a quick clarification of the current point or a question to further clarification. Not to be used for opinion- or emotion-laden responses / points of view.
*Point-of-process - As per the triangle of thumbs and index fingers shown in the top-right corner of the image, and aptly described by Vicky above.
--[[User:Tunabananas|Tunabananas]] ([[User talk:Tunabananas|talk]]) 05:44, 3 February 2013 (UTC)

=='''What next?'''==
*Vicky will round you up, and we will agree upon a set of hand signals.
*We will spread the hand signals idea around as a Sudo Room social meme, subliminally convincing everyone of how great hand signals are for our organizational health. 
*We will make sketches of our agreed-upon hand signals, and chose a Wednesday meeting to propose them to.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5653">Career Centre-Based Certification Training Courses For Domestic Green Energy - The Inside Track

'Green Energy' is the use of resources such as wind, tides and geothermal heating to provide us with our everyday energy requirement. When 'Green', they are all thought to be replenishable and natural. It is easy to think that we may be travelling back in time when we think of items such as wind power and windmills. Generally, this is the result of using up to date ideas, specifically those that are planet friendly and eco-efficient.

In the home environment, one can see examples such as Solar Thermal and Solar Water Heating Collectors. To gain electricity from roof panels you would need solar electrical panels (PV's). Following on from this is a process known as Biomass Energy - which includes Boilers burning wood and other fuels. Then we have the ancient energy of the Sun and the heat that comes from it - now called Ground Source Heat Pumps. At the end there are two of the most mature forms of energy production in the UK - albeit renamed now to Wind Turbines and Hydropower.

Solar Thermal Energy Systems - Also known as Solar Energy, this mainly uses two, albeit different types of solar panels to get the desired results. To begin with, we have the concept of drawing energy from the Sun to heat water - known as Solar Water Heating Collectors. Added to this is the generation of electricity from solar radiation - known as Photovoltaism, or more commonly Solar Electrical panels. Solar Panels themselves need to be away from all light blocks, and should be on south facing roofs at angles of 30 degrees from the horizontal plane.

As a result, Solar Water Power is often considered the most common form of Solar Energy in the UK. Solar Water heating systems can provide over 50 percent of a household's hot water requirement during the year. Getting a professional fitting will cost around 2-5k, however, doing the job yourself could make it as low as 500 to 1500 pounds in total.

Biomass Energy Based Systems: Including all natural energy forms derived from plant and animal products - such as wood, straw, poultry litter and 'energy crops'. It is by using these materials in new ways to create energy that makes it so exciting. It is a useful point to make that the UK is one of the major producers of Biomass fuels within Europe. It should be borne in mind that the whole process is designed to produce energy without an impact on CO2. Having a tree planted in place of another (that is felled for energy production) helps overall.

By the growth of Short Rotation Crops (SRC), the UK is able to maximise the 'Energy Crops' return overall. Also producing high yields of dry matter are the perennial grasses. Equally significant within this practice sit Municipal and Agricultural waste products. One natural offshoot of agricultural work is Agricultural Waste. Of equal importance is Municipal Waste, which comes from recycled wood and food.

Geo-Thermal Energy: The constant energy of the Sun heating the Earth results in both warm water and electricity being produced. By using the ground source temperature of approximately 12 degrees, we can either heat or cool buildings within the UK. These heat pumps do need some power to operate; but for every one unit of energy they use, they generate four units of energy in return. By using energy from solar electrical panels or wind turbines to power them, heat source pumps can be almost 100 percent renewable in energy production.

Systems Based On Wind Energy: Wind Energy as a sustainable source of energy has been going on for millennia. That aside, the ability to generate energy and both transfer this into the home or the local grid has been a relatively new option. To be fair, the UK has the highest level of wind generation within Europe. The fact remains that in the UK, there exists the ability to realise 10 percent of our electricity requirement from wind power - as opposed to the current value of just 1 percent. Although electricity is still being produced from between 2-10 p per kWh, it could be generated from as little as 2p per kWh. Because of this, it is estimated that it takes between half a year to three quarters of a year to cover the installation costs.

Lastly, we have a discipline that the UK does well - namely Hydropower. Although new in its approach, the act of harnessing energy from water has been going on for a long time. It is this type of energy production that could meet 2 percent of all the UK's demand.

A hydropower system uses a turbine to create energy from moving water. Utilising natural river runs, or water drop-offs (through dams,) the turbines can work without a reservoir of water. It is by using the eroded national distribution systems, that allows for outdated sluices and dams to be used by techniques known as 'Micro-Hydro'. Although a lesser known form of electricity output, this process could supply 200mW of UK demand. The expected cost of installing a system such as this would be between 200 pounds and 3k per kW of output.

Due to the energy requirements worldwide, 'Green Energy' is naturally growing at a fast rate. To be fair, the UK domestic market is actually leading the resurgence, with a variety of schemes.

Electrician and Plumbers are thought to be key in providing expertise during domestic installations. It is the political view of this type of energy generation that results in grants and financial aid becoming ever-more prevalent. As a new industry, there are a range of new certificates to gain. Electrical or plumbing training that incorporates green technology could be very useful for the future.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8972">NOTE: a lot of people think that you can get on IRC and talk to people right away.  That only works if people are in the channel you want at that very moment, and paying attention to that screen on their computer.

The reality is that most conversations in IRC happen over hours or days, so the only way to fully experience a channel such as #sudoroom is to find a way to stay logged into IRC continuously.  If you have a desktop computer that stays powered on and connected to the internet, this is easy.  Otherwise, you need to connect to a computer that stays on (such as a server) and leave an IRC session running there, using &quot;screen&quot; or &quot;tmux&quot; as described below.

If you log into IRC and say Hello and nobody gets back you to you for an hour, that is totally normal.  If you log out five minutes after asking a question, people will make fun of you an hour later when they look at their IRC sessions.

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is an instant messaging service that has been used on the internet since the early 1990s. IRC is made possible by the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat Internet Relay Chat Protocol (IRCP)], an application layer protocol. The chat process works on a client/server networking model. IRC clients are computer programs that a user can install on their system. These clients communicate with chat servers to transfer messages to other clients. IRC is mainly designed for group communication in discussion forums, called channels, but also allows one-on-one communication via private messages as well as chat and data transfer, including file sharing.

Many [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_instant_messaging_protocols other instant messaging services] exist, however many services are proprietary and/or rely on a centralized platform. This does not appeal to organizations that wish to establish a channel of communication that can be adopted by users without fear of unwanted regulations by the service/platform provider. Although open source protocols such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMPP XMPP (formerly Jabber)] exist, IRC continues to be used because it is lightweight and stable.

IRC consists of channels. Each channel is like a chat room, and is represented by a name that begins with '#' followed by a string that represents the primary topic of the channel. Examples:  #html, #css, #javascript, #go-lang.

== Recommended Clients ==

There are many various IRC clients available for many platforms.

=== Graphical Clients ===

* Cross-platform
** [https://www.pidgin.im/download/ Pidgin]
* Mac OS X
** [https://adium.im/ Adium]

=== Command Line Interface Clients ===

These clients are intended to be used from the command line interface (CLI), also known as the &quot;terminal&quot;.

* [https://irssi.org/ irssi]

== Basics ==

For those that are new to IRC, it’s a good idea to become familiar with the [http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html common commands] that IRC programs support. Here are a few:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Command !! Example !! Description
|-
| /join #channel_name || /join #sudoroom ||Join a channel
|-
| /me &lt;action&gt; || /me waves hello || Announces some action
|-
| /msg &lt;nickname&gt; &lt;message&gt; || /msg juul Hey! I need some help  || Send a direct message to another user
|-
| /ignore &lt;nickname&gt; || /ignore annoyingperson || Block someone that is harassing you
|-
|}

Although the above commands are likely to be supported by all IRC client programs, some only apply to specific clients. The following are supported by [https://irssi.org/ irssi]:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Command !! Example !! Description
|-
| /help || /help || View documentation on supported commands
|-
| /help &lt;command&gt; || /help connect || View documentation on a specific supported command
|-
| /connect &lt;server address&gt; &lt;port&gt; || /connect irc.freenode.net 8001 || Connect to an IRC server
|-
| /set nick &lt;nick&gt; || /set nick someGuy2015 || Register your nickname with the IRC server/network
|-
| /set real_name &lt;real name&gt; || /set nick Bill Murray || Register your real name within the IRC server/network
|-
| /quit || /quit || Quits IRC program
|-
| /exit || /exit || Quits IRC program
|-
|}

See [https://irssi.org/documentation/ IRSSI Documentation] for more commands.

== FreeNode ==

Many programming/hacking communities establish a channel on the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freenode FreeNode IRC network] to facilitate discussions and provide support to members of their community.

=== Registering with FreeNode ===

The FreeNode IRC network allows you to register your nickname and associate it with your email address. This is done by using the following commands:

  /msg nickserv REGISTER &lt;password&gt; &lt;email&gt;

You should receive a message informing you that you need to check your email account and obtain instructions to verify yourself.

To make sure that your email address isn’t revealed to other users, use the following command to ensure that it is hidden.

  /msg NickServ SET HIDEMAIL ON

You can verify your information with the NickServ by using:

  /msg nickserv info

== Persistent CLI Client ==

This section is a guide to setting up a command line based IRC client on a persistently running machine so that it stays connected within a channel even when you are not connected to the machine via SSH. This results in the ability to reconnect and view the messages in the channel that occurred even when you were not connected.

These instructions assume you are using an Ubuntu machine, and will be using the [https://irssi.org/ irssi] client.

=== Client Machine ===

You can setup a system at home and configure your home network device(s) to make that machine available via the internet, or alternatively gain shell access to a server on the internet. There are services that provide free or paid shell access, with features and support for IRC that varies. Some of these services even provide support for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRC_bot IRC bots]. Alternatively you can pay for a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_server Virtual Private Server (VPS)] for as low as $5 a month through services such as [digitalocean.com DigitalOcean], thus providing you with an entire UNIX-like server environment that you can use as you wish.

=== Install Client ===

Install the irssi client using the following command:

  apt-get install irssi

After it’s done installing, simply run the program

  irssi

=== Configure ===

There is a configuration file in ~/.irssi/config that you can inspect, but you can use commands from within the program to configure IRSSI to automatically perform when you first open the program. 

The following commands will configure IRSSI to connect to the Freenode network with an SSL connection, with automatic joining of the #sudoroom channel.

  /network add Freenode
  /server add -auto -ssl -ssl_verify -ssl_capath /etc/ssl/certs -network Freenode irc.freenode.net 7000
  /channel add -auto #sudoroom Freenode
  /save

After you’ve successfully registered your FreeNode nick name, you can run this command to configure IRSSI to login automatically after connecting to FreeNode.

  /network add -autosendcmd &quot;/msg nickserv identify &lt;password&gt; ;wait 2000&quot; Freenode

=== Windows ===

irssi support separate “windows” for the different channels you are connected to, or for the different people you are chatting with. If for some reason you do not see information on the screen for a command you’ve run, it may be displayed in another window.

An Ubuntu terminal can use the ALT key combined with a number key (e.g. ALT+1, ALT+2, ALT+3, etc) to switch between the different displays in IRSSI. This will not work via SSH however, so you will need to use the /window command instead.

  /WINDOW NEW                    - Create new split window
  /WINDOW NEW HIDE               - Create new hidden window
  /WINDOW CLOSE                  - Close split or hidden window
  
  /WINDOW HIDE [&lt;number&gt;|&lt;name&gt;] - Make the split window hidden window
  /WINDOW SHOW &lt;number&gt;|&lt;name&gt;   - Make the hidden window a split window
  
  /WINDOW SHRINK [&lt;lines&gt;]       - Shrink the split window
  /WINDOW GROW [&lt;lines&gt;]         - Grow the split window
  /WINDOW BALANCE                - Balance the sizes of all split windows

=== Managing Process ===

You can use [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen GNU screen] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux tmux] to maintain a terminal session that will persist even after you disconnect from the SSH session on your client machine.

For example, you can run 'screen' to start a screen session. Once the session is started, run any program you wish. To disconnect from the session press CTRL-A, followed by D key. You can then safely disconnect from your SSH session. When you return, use `screen -r` to reconnect.

See [http://carina.org.uk/screenirssi.shtml How to use screen and irssi] and [https://michael.lustfield.net/linux/irssi-using-screen-and-ssh IRSSI Using Screen and SSH]</text>

===Summary===

Sudo membership should:
* Be easy to facilitate
* Be welcoming and accessible
* Shepherd applicants toward [[Articles_of_Association#Values|the values that sudo embodies]]
* Prioritize the well-being of the community

===Notes===

I want sudo room to have welcoming, accessible, and good / encouraging experience for potential and new members that maintains and preserves the values sudo room's community already embodies and seeks to perform.

I want sudo room to have a membership process that encourages members to pay their dues and to take on responsibility that empowers themselves to participate doocratically. 

I would like this process to be a simultaneously non-intinimidating easing into the culture of sudo room, through the process itself, AND 

my main concern right now is that all application processes are intimidating. secondly, there's an aspect of interview-interviewer judgment that weigh on the process. Both should be mitigated as much as possible. 
* First, we can have small and easy approachable steps 
* Second, we should make it more welcoming, and a process that actually introduces people to the space, culture, values, history, etc.

==Approach==

# Immediate hacks
#* Change the application online
#** Better explain the membership process at all.
#** Change to present tense
#** Change questions / format
#** Add placeholder / help text in form to explain meaning of questions, etc.
#* Change the agenda at meeting (informally)
# Policy changes
#* Now
#* In the future, soon (later)
# New system - https://github.com/sudoroom/sudo-humans
#* New process / incentives to do membership
#* Peer-to-peer system (rather than full group)

==Policy Changes==

* Have new policy for membership postponements or blocking concerns. 
** Use individual member volunteer to discuss blocking concerns with member-applicant
*** Meaning, we don't do this during the meeting, or on public email list, yay!
* Clarify that folks with blocking concerns do not need to be identified, but at least one member must be able to communicate with the member-applicant being blocked.
** Communication around blocking concerns should be consented upon by the members present for the member-applicant's application. This communication should prioritize protecting the privacy and anonymity of any members with blocking concern, as necessary, and at discretion of the membership. 

===Future===
* Peer-to-peer
* Membership questions update
** Who, if anyone, do you know at sudo room?</text>

===== Notes from Inclusivity Meeting 1/5/12: =====

'''Challenges:'''&lt;br /&gt;
- it takes time to understand that you can just show up to a space like this without knowing anyone. talks/classes help with this.
- talks/classes that would not be intimidating?

'''Organizations to outreach to:''' &lt;br /&gt;
* Community technology centers (http://www.eastmont.net/) - felicia will contact them about possible collaboration
* OTX West: http://www.otxwest.org/ - OTX gives away thousands of computers. how can we collab?
* mosswood rec center - sudoer dan f teaches classes in programming. marina will reach out.
* libraries - teen zones at oakland public library branches have computers for youth to use. 
* morning youth? sudo room is available for classes/regular events all mornings except for t/th (morning math is t/th).
* involvement with lolspace (praveen)
* fixit clinic - have held events at SR in the past. max?
* one laptop per child sf: http://www.olpcsf.org/
* youth uprising - already working with them on oakwiki. how to work further with them? they have equipment and youth participants. what could SR offer?
* involvement with other hackerspaces - [http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Bay_Area_Consortium_of_Hackerspaces BACH], lolspace
* US FIRST - for inspiration robotics science technology
** Oakland teams: Oakland Tech (2013 Season FIRST Robotics Competition aka ULTIMATE ASCENT Teams in CA-USA)

'''classes are the most basic way to be accessible'''
* possible classes:
** open source install night
** raspberry pi primer
** arduino (hol)
** audio production/radio
** tech support - fix my browser, my computer is slow, etc. intro to computers and troubleshooting. sudo office hours - come with your desktop. (need windows, apple, people etc.)
** knitting circle. possible outreach - rock paper scissors (they have very little space), 25th street collective. &lt;= felicia will reach out
** performance nights
** 3D printer class - how to use it, how to model, how it works. (jack might teach with jae)
** testing of sudo room equipment day, =&gt; fixing day, good way to publicize by letting people know what the space offers.
** vanilla (ray)

'''Publicity to excluded communities remains a challenge. we do not have any active publicity programs at the moment.'''&lt;br/&gt;
* postcards with basic info: photo, who we are, what we do, map, potential classes, how to get in touch/involved. &lt;= mk will reach out to sudo room designers
* more stickers?
* cards
* intro video - who would be interested? (max)
* ideas from len :)

'''Newcomer engagement.''' &lt;br/&gt;
* [[Welcome]] FAQ is a good start.
* open tech support/instruction/fixing nights - open nights where &quot;you come and people will be available to help you&quot; (as opposed to just working on their own projects)?
* how-to guide for sudoers to engage with newcomers to the space (possibly also for speaking with friends, etc. about sudo room)?

'''Equipment''' &lt;br/&gt;
* what kind of equipment/space needs can we focus on for the long term to engage with  how to get more computers? how to fix existing computers/equipment.
* day to do inventory and test items currently in the space. this should lead to equipment fixing days.
* more build/organize days a la &quot;move in day&quot;
* list of equipment ideas
** more computers
** sewing machines/craft materials
** arduino kits/breadboards
** proper kitchen things - possible collaboration with uptown kitchen (ray) (felicia does candymaking :))

'''accessibility for children.'''
** kids corner. there isn't a good place for a child to sit even (a couch). what should contents of kids corner be? (the space needs to be reconfigured). piece of carpet for people to sit on. or a fort.
** check out [[Education]] project page for more.

'''internal communication discussion'''
* listserv is not effective, but what would be better? there are too many emails. **fix sudo discuss list.
* buddypress - CUNY has academic commons, etc. &quot;commons in a box&quot; (on github), it has groups and let's people only get filtered emails. (alternate solution: more robust use of project pages on wiki). friday filosophy trial run for buddypress.
* encourage people to tag their emails.
* summaries of discussions happening on the mailing list - who will do?

* poll for regular meetings.


===== Notes from Inclusivity and Access Session at 1st Annual &quot;State of the Room&quot; Unconference 12/8/12: =====

participants: aestetix, vicky, matt, jordan, marina, emily, matt, jenny, praveen, troy

* what are the ''challenges''
* what are some ''practical steps'' we can take (and encourage others to take) to ensure that sudo room is inclusive
* what are the ''long term'' investments, strategies, and initiatives we need to undertake to sustain an attentiveness to inclusivity at sudo room

current challenge to making sudo room inclusive: if you know about sudoroom/hackerspace, and you're a hacker, then you will come. we're not doing a great job at bringing new people in. how to reach out and welcome people who don't already self-identify as &quot;hackers&quot; or &quot;good with technology&quot; or &quot;techie&quot;? it's a leaky pipeline, it must be patched at different places.

# identity: itches that you have can be scratched with technology and with spaces , that you are the kind of person that are capable of that
# being aware of hackerspaces
# knowing tha you can go there
# when you go there, wanting to stay there

challenges:
* communication, what is a hackerspace, language barriers
* spanish accessibility at SR. spanish-based classes? spanish/english labels for things in SR. add spanish to the labelmaker ;)
* beyond one spanish-language class...making everything spanish-inclusive.


* how many computers do we have here at sudoroom that people can use? TOMORROW.
* how is the space open/available/accessible to disabled individuals. also crucial for older people.
* ability: well-connected disability community in bay area
* childcare and accessibility for parents and children.
* important to continue to have this conversation. add to agenda? &quot;exclusivity check&quot; once a month.
* guide for hackerspaces for inclusivity and accessibility
* survey of problems?
* human capital: lolspace has a problem recruiting spanish-language tech people. difficult to make strategic affiliations. tumis.
* inclusivity and diversity is a human capital issue. look at hte people we could be building coalitions with and who we are not using.
* reaching out to new people. how to foster a culture of that? 1) onboarding process 2) promote a culture where people are empowered and prepared to talk to new people. empower people to act as ambassadors. 3) designated ambassador or designated person who does outreach.
* challenge in ambassadorial culture as the group scales. the role of the ambassador is to ensure that hte group is attentive to diversity and outreach.


* outreach to communities is really difficult. getting people in the door and getting them to understand why they belong there is hard. how do we do outreach?
* hackerspace - problem of language (either not sure what it is or have preconception), solution to show people the space. alternate problem: how do we adequately explain what it is.
* really communicating all the time what we're doing. being public about what we do. both in terms of broadcasting and in terms of our friends and community.
* ex of aaron coming in off the street.
* do we have a video about what this is? talk to rusty
* not just the idea of hte hackerspace is new, consensus is new, non-commercial forms of interaction.
* metaphors for talking to people about hackerspaces - a library?
* when building things, attention to the users is key.
* how to do partnerships with existing groups. how to partner with them to meet with them to meet on their terms. ex: we have space, but we don't have human resources to coordinate. what do we offer and what
* monthly open house: first friday. maybe something else? ex: mitch's intro to circuits. open hack nights (how to do that without implying that the rest of the time is closed). &quot;getting to know you&quot;
* marketing - how do we market ourselves?
* how would you explain sudoroom to a stranger: a group of volunteers who come together and share resources, ideas, and work on projects together using technological equipment. tailor your explanation to the person that you're talking to. talk about what people do here, not what it is. space for hosting your group, a place to find resources (people, technological, etc.).


* future events: followup on mailing list, ongoing discussions within sudoer, with sudoers. jigsaw meeting style.
* sensitivity classes
* &quot;how to keep a safe space&quot;

= Overview = 

* Learn to take complex data and condense information into powerful graphics that communicate, '''spur action''' resulting in positive economic and social change. 

* Take data from data.gov and create a 3D Printed model inspired by http://make.opendata.ch/wiki/doku.php?id=project:transport:tangiblestatistics

We'll review examples from the famous Tufte Book Visualizing Information. We'll also work with SudoRoom resident mathematicians to show how powerfully data can be visualized and change the course of events. We'll also learn from lessons made by famous comic book artists such as R. Crumb, Art Spiegelman, matt Groenig and Lynda Barry.

= Open Source Tools =

SudoRoom is an open-source space. 

We use open-source tools.

Focus will be on sketching infographics on pen and paper instead of focusing too much on an internet start-up that preassembles infographics for you.

Drawing will also enable you to escape the smart-art cliches found in most powerpoint presentations.

Good open source software:

* OpenOffice.org

      <comment>/* Disabling BIOS protection */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5583">This describes how to install Ubuntu as the native OS on a Chromebook CR-48 (the original Chromebook).

To do this, you need to take the Chromebook apart and cover up a connection point with tape, then flash a different bios and finally boot from a Ubuntu USB install disk.

This guide was tested with Ubuntu 12.10 (64 bit version).

= Flashing the BIOS =

== Disabling BIOS protection ==

Follow the instructions [http://cr-48.wikispaces.com/Open+the+Cr-48 here]. Remove any sd card or fake sd card in the sd card slot first. When opening the case, it might stick on the headphone jack. Just use a screwdriver to slightly bend the case to unstick it.

== Flashing the BIOS ==

Follow the instructions [http://cr-48.wikispaces.com/Set+Developer+Mode here] to enable development mode. You can skip creating the Chrome OS recovery drive. You can always do that later (since it's done on another computer anyway). Instead of emailing the backup of the old bios to yourself, you can insert and mount usb stick and back it up to the usb stick. You can also put the new bios file on the same usb stick. 

You need to flash an alternate BIOS called InsydeH2O. 

On another laptop, insert a USB stick. 

Format it if it's not already formatted (WARNING: this will erase everything on the usb stick):

 sudo mkfs.ext3 /dev/sdX1 # Replace the sdX with the actual device name of your usb stick!

If you want to find the device name of your usb stick, you can run the following command and then plug in your usb stick. The device name should show up somewhere in the text. Hit ctrl+c when done.

 tail -f /var/log/syslog

Mount your drive if it's not already mounted. If it's already mounted, run the 'mount' command to see where the device name of your usb disk is mounted:

  sudo mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt

Change directory to the mounted usb drive:

  cd /mnt

Download the new bios to the usb drive and extract it:

  sudo wget http://cr-48.wikispaces.com/file/view/cr48.bin.tar.gz/235881614/cr48.bin.tar.gz
  sudo tar xvzf cr48.bin.tar.gz

Unmount the usb drive again:

  cd 
  sudo umount /mnt

Now boot your chromebook and wait for the login screen. When it appears, press ctrl+alt+F2 (the right arrow two over from the escape key), log in with the password chronos. Then do the following to back up the flash rom and write the new flash rom:

  sudo su -
  mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
  cd /mnt
  flashrom -r backup.bin 
  flashrom -w cr48.bin
  cd /
  umount /mnt

Now connect the usb drive to another computer and copy backup.bin to a safe place.

Shut down the chromebook.

Congratulations. You now have a new bios! 

= Enable booting from USB =

Boot the computer and keep hitting F2 (the right-pointing arrow two over from the escape key). You should get to the bios menu. Go to the &quot;exit&quot; menu point, select &quot;Load Optimal Defaults&quot; and hit enter. Answer yes to the question. Go to the &quot;boot&quot; menu point and disable &quot;UEFI Boot&quot;. Make sure &quot;USB Boot&quot; is enabled.

= Install Ubuntu =

Create a Ubuntu bootable installer usb disk. You can find guides for how to do this elsewhere. There is nothing special about this for the chromebook. You can use the same usb stick as the one you used to back up the bios, just remember to copy the bios backup to a safe place first.

Turn off the chromebook, insert the bootable ubuntu usb disk and boot up while repeatedly pressing F10 (the volume + key). It should pop up a menu where you can select to boot from usb. Select the USB device and hit enter. After that, you will be prompted to either try ubuntu or install ubuntu. Select install and hit enter. Once the installer is loaded, it will begin asking you questions. One of the questions will be about whether to install Ubuntu along side the existing operating system, or to erase the harddrive and install ubuntu on the entire drive. Click the &quot;something else&quot; option at the bottom. 

Now delete all of the partitions by selecting them one at a time and clicking the minus button. Once they are all removed, add the following partitions:

*A 200 megabyte partition with an ext2 filesystem and /boot as the mount point.
*A partition that takes up the rest of the space with an ext4 filesystem and / as the mount point.

Ignore any warnings about EFI or a missing swap partition and continue. Let the install finish.

= Getting it to boot =

Unfortunately Ubuntu won't boot because of two things. First, it didn't set the /boot partition's &quot;bootable&quot; flag. Second, it installed the EFI version of the GRUB 2 boot loader. You need to replace it with the non-EFI version.

== Setting the bootable flag ==

Boot from the usb stick again, choose try ubuntu (not install). Once it's booted, open a terminal (you can do this with ctrl+alt+t) and type:

 sudo gparted

Wait for gparted to open. Once it's open, find the partition with &quot;/boot&quot; as the mount-point in the list and right-click it. Choose the option &quot;Manage flags&quot;, then check the &quot;boot&quot; flag and click close. Now close gparted. Don't close the terminal yet.

== Replacing EFI GRUB 2 with non-EFI GRUB 2 ==

While still in the terminal, enter:

 sudo su -
 mount /dev/sda2 /mnt/
 mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
 mount -t proc none /mnt/proc
 mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
 mount -o bind /dev/pts /mnt/dev/pts
 mount -o bind /run /mnt/run
 mount -t sysfs sys /mnt/sys
 chroot /mnt/ /bin/bash
 apt-get install grub-pc

Answer yes to any questions. Then shut down the computer, unplug the usb stick and power back up. It should now boot into Ubuntu correctly.

Hurray! You have turned a web terminal into a useful computer! \o/

===Update 02/28/2014===
Subject: Re: [sudo-discuss] STATE FARM: GENERAL LIABILITY QUOTE AND
        RENTERS INSURANCE BROCHURE
Hey all,

I paid $149.32 for two months of installments and a $2 filing fee from the
sudo room account and passed the certificate of insurance on to the
landlords.

// Matt

[[File:SUDO ROOM Certificate of Ins.pdf|thumb|insurance]]

===2141 Broadway===
Requests from the landlords:
:&quot;Liability insurance with George and I as named insureds for $1M that covers the usual (injury, damages, fire, theft, etc.) for officers and members of the Sudo room re. the building.   When you have the policy they will give us a certificate of insurance.&quot;

So this seems to imply we need the typical General Liability insurance to cover $1M with the landlords as named insureds.

==Research==
===General Liability Insurance===
via InsuranceForNonProfits.org:
&quot;This is typically the “core” coverage for a nonprofit. Most commercial general liability insurance provides coverage for a wide range of acts or offenses which result in bodily injury, personal injury, advertising injury or property damage to a third party. The most common type of incident covered by this policy is a “slip and fall”. Commercial general liability (often referred to as CGL or GL) insurance is generally available as an “occurrence” policy, which provides significant advantages over a “claims-made” policy.

A general liability policy may also extend to special events. If your organization conducts any type of special events, you should make sure that your general liability policy includes special events and that you follow any requirements about providing notice of special events.&quot;

===Talking Points===
*All-ages meeting area separate from workshop area.
*Anyone under 18 accompanied by an adult guardian.
*No seriously dangerous tools in the space.

===Underwriter Paragraph===
Just a draft of key points to make, please prettify the language:

Sudo Room is a non-profit membership organization that provides work space and meeting space for members and their guests, as well as access to tools and materials for creative and technical projects. Member projects and workshops are artistic, scientific, and educational in nature, Activities include 3D printing; audio production, recording and broadcasting; painting and sculpture; electronics assembly and soldering; and computer programming. Events include talks, lectures, workshops and presentations in a clean, safe space.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7933">As of (??? -- this text was added in 2012) Sudo Room has a dedicated paired fusion line from LMI.net. Upon installation our reported speeds (with dual Annex M) were 26.5/3.7. Our Sonic (we used to have sonic.net, but switched) modem is in bridged mode, and the wifi network &quot;sudoroom&quot; is served by an Asus RT-N10+ running OpenWRT compiled from the latest git trunk. The router is named '''torta''' - admin access is by ssh &amp; https. Contact [[User:Yardena|Yardena]] for the key or password.

This page contains a breakdown of Internet service options in Oakland and surrounding areas. See also [[mesh]].

== Internet options for Oakland residents ==
Relevant email thread starting Nov. 23, 2013, with some good info: [http://lists.sudoroom.org/pipermail/sudo-discuss/2013-November/004670.html]

=== DSL ===
* DSL is a digital Internet signal transmitted over an ordinary phone line. It's typically faster than dialup, and it uses the line in a way that allows simultaneous use of the phone.
* The phone lines in Oakland are owned by AT&amp;T, and you can buy DSL service (called &quot;UVerse&quot;) through '''AT&amp;T'''.
* Other Internet Service Providers also sell DSL service over those same lines; you can get this service without any direct business relationship with AT&amp;T.
* '''Sonic.net''' is one such service. DSL plus phone costs a little under $50/month (including taxes, equipment rental, etc.)
* '''DSLextreme.com''' provides good customer service and reliable connectivity (in my experience); $33/mth for 5-6 mbps
* The quality and length of the phone line between your house and the [[wikipedia:Class 5 telephone switch|telephone exchange's central office]] will dramatically affect the speed you can expect. In parts of West Oakland (and elsewhere?) the lines are very poor. On poor lines, you might get speeds like 3 MBit downstream, and 1 MBit upstream -- enough for a video stream like Netflix or a video call like Skype, but not enough to do multiple high-bandwidth tasks at the same time.
* It is possible with some DSL providers (at least with Sonic) to adjust the balance between upstream and downstream speeds. See Sonic's [https://wiki.sonic.net/wiki/Annex_M_FAQ Annex M FAQ] for details. For a data point: my connection over crappy copper is 4 Mbps down/1Mbps up (under the default Annex A), and when tested with Annex M it was 1.4 Mbps down/1.6 Mbps up.

=== Cable ===
* '''Comcast''' is the cable TV provider for (all of?) Oakland. You can get Internet service through their lines. There are several speed categories; all are faster than DSL. Comcast offers many different packages; typically you will have to get cable TV and/or phone service along with your Internet connection. Many of their plans require a 1 or 2 year contract, which you will probably not be able to get out of if you move or change providers.

=== Fiber optic, T1, direct ethernet ===
* Fiber optic based Internet can be outrageously fast.
* AT&amp;T offers fiber to the home in some parts of Oakland. (It's technically &quot;fiber to the pole outside your home&quot;, and then standard copper phone lines deliver the signal into your home.) There is a 1 year contract. Be sure you know what you are getting, since AT&amp;T uses the &quot;UVerse&quot; brand for both DSL and fiber. [http://www.buyatt.com/u-verse-internet/]
** NOTE: As of 1/14, the &quot;Pro&quot; and &quot;Elite&quot; levels of service (least expensive) each offer 1 Mbit upstream; &quot;Max&quot; offers 1.5 Mbit. They don't say this anywhere on their web site.
* Other service providers seem to only offer it as a business service, not residential. See '''[http://sunstreamnetworks.com/internet/ Sunstream]''', '''[http://www.fastmetrics.com/fiber-optic-internet-availability-map.php#.Urnl_WRDvPc FastMetrics]''', and '''[http://lmi.net LMi]'''.
* A T1 line (copper wire similar to phone wire, dedicated to networking) is what businesses have used for decades. It's generally too expensive for residential use and there are usually better options for business use.
* For direct ethernet, see [http://www.megapath.com/promos/ethernet-dataplus/ Megapath]. Asymetric looks fairly affordable (but more expensive than DSL, cable, etc.), but [http://www.megapath.com/promos/ethernet/ symmetric] is outrageously expensive. Their offerings are considered for businesses, not residential; so they have guaranteed bandwidth and uptime, they don't care what you do with the bandwidth (e.g. sharing with neighbors), etc.

=== WiMAX/other wireless ===
* '''[http://www.lmi.net/services/high-speed-wireless LMI offers point-to-point wireless]''' service, which involves installing an antenna on your rooftop. You need a line-of-sight to either the Berkeley Hills or Sausalito. Setup cost is high because of the installation (over $300) and 6 Mbps down/3 Mbps up costs about $55/month.
* '''[http://www.telepacific.com/offer/data-networking/wireless-internet-access/ Telepacific]''' also offers fixed-wireless service.
* Many cell phone providers now offer home Internet service that may be competitive with the options above. For instance, '''[http://shop.sprint.com/mysprint/shop/plan/plan_wall.jsp?tabId=pt_data_plans_tab&amp;flow=AAL&amp;planFamilyType=null Sprint]''' has plans as low as $35/month. This approach also has the advantage that you can take your Internet connection with you (if you have a portable modem).
* You may be able to &quot;tether&quot; your existing cell phone, providing Internet service to your laptop, without even signing up for a new plan; this can be really useful as a temporary measure, but is probably not practical for everyday use!
* '''[http://Monkeybrains.net MonkeyBrains]''': Currently available in San Francisco only. (Not sure about the note above, though -- perhaps it is coming to Oakland??)

=== Satellite ===
Satellite connections typically offer high downstream speeds but low upstream speeds, and higher latency than other connection types. (Latency is the amount of time it takes to initiate a connection.) Fine for watching streaming video, not so great for video conferencing, uploading your own videos to YouTube, etc.
* [http://www.hughesnet.com/index.cfm?page=Plans-Pricing HughesNet Gen4] is available through dealers in Vallejo and Hayward, and should work anywhere in Oakland that you can see the sky!

=== Building-specific ===
* '''[http://www.webpass.net/ WebPass]''' offers ''very'' fast Internet (100 Mbps) for $50/month, but it is only available in apartment buildings that have made an arrangement with WebPass. If you live in an apartment building, use their web site to check if your building has WebPass.

=== Mesh ===
* Some Sudo people are currently (fall 2013) trying to establish a &quot;mesh&quot; network that would allow you to make wireless network connections to your neighbors, and perhaps the Internet or other services. This is an aspiration, but will hopefully become a reality soon. See the wiki page '''[[mesh]]''' for techy details, or the more public-facing site:
* '''[https://peoplesopen.net peoplesopen.net]'''

==== Terms of service ====

Some ISPs allow sharing of Internet access and others do not. We provide node owners with a list of local ISPs that are known to allow sharing of Internet access and advise them that some ISPs may not allow sharing. The worst case scenario here is that one or more users get their Internet disconnected for terms of service violation.

The ISPs in the East Bay that allow Internet Connection sharing (that we know of) are:

*[http://www.monkeybrains.net/ MonkeyBrains wifi]
*[http://www.sonic.net/ Sonic.net DSL]
*[http://www.lmi.net/ LMI (Sonic.net reseller) DSL]
*[http://www.netwood.net Netwood DSL]
*[http://www.hughesnet.com Hughes Net Satellite Internet]

=== Dialup ===
* Dialup Internet used to be the only common way to get online. Your modem allows your computer to &quot;talk&quot; over your phone line to the Internet. You can't use the phone for voice calls while you are online. The speeds are very slow compared to all other options listed here.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="583">Norcal Internet Learning Festival aims to create a space for people to live in nature and use the internet to learn skills and work on projects. NILF goes from mid July until mid August. We anticipate roughly 100 participants though this number will likely vary greatly during the month. NILF strives to be ecologically friendly having a minimal impact on the land. We are looking to use 3 - 5 acres of land for this purpose.

* Jenny: Connect to the tribe? Documenting stories, cultural preservation, co-learning, urban hacker/maker respite,
* Max: Pulling down the culturally-created curtain of mystery around the tools people use every day; that we feel like we can't touch or don't feel confident touching / deconstructing - facilitating familiarity with tools - deeply skeptical of Burning Man - more interested in things that are transformative after the Thing is over; positive and useful change for communities that we have good relationships with
* Rikke: Appropriate technologies / environmentalism, way too many hours in a lab; lived in Mendocino County w/ satellite uplink, trying to figure out a backhaul across several ridgelines straight west, lived part of childhood in Tanzania so familiar w/ underserved communities; research on deployment of IT in rural subsaharan Africa.

* What other historically disadvantaged communities could we also help?
* Examine ICT4D research;

=Discussion=
* Success defined as having fun
* More important to have clear questions than clear organizers
* Definitely start thinking about fencing

=Ideal Numbers=
* Yahel: Low thousands - how do you stop it?
* Rikke: 12-1400 people; has helped organized festivals with 75-95,000 people in Europe

** 2-day passes, day passes, week passes etc;
* Max: Tickets? Paid? Fences?
* Jenny: would like to keep it 'village sized' with some events or summer-camp style weekend workshops
* Rikke: First group of people will build it for you, should be free. Second group should be promoted to, need to have an idea of a target audience --&gt; But then you need to deliver.

=Key Considerations=
* Water Supply

[[File:Inventory - robot arm qr code.jpg|thumb|robot arm qr code]]

'''''&quot;Why is Sudo Room covered in QR codes?&quot; you might ask.'''''

Sudo Room is using the '''Labitrack''' inventory tracking software from the Copenhagen-based [https://labitat.dk/ Labitat] hackerspace. Labitrack allows simple 2D barcode labeling (QR codes) of individual items in the Sudo Room, and creates a wiki-based online inventory of those items. To look up what items are available at Sudo Room (or add new items), you need to:

# Connect to the correct LAN/wifi (named: &quot;sudo mesh&quot; or &quot;omni ballroom&quot;).
# Then, simply type into your web-browser the address: http://stuff.sudo.

When you scan a 2D barcode, you will be taken to an item address, for example: http://o.sudoroom.org/1. The number at the end refers to the ID of the scanned item. This will immediately redirect you to http://sudoroom.org/wiki/O:1, where you can add information about the item. When you create a new item in the web app, a label will immediately be printed on the teeny tiny printer currently located on the main bookcase. A future goal is that the information you enter when you create the label will automatically be entered into the wiki page for the item. (updates, people?)


==What's the point?==
Here's the point: 
*We want to document the tools, projects and people available in the Sudo Room. 
::''Wiki pages should provide info such as instructions for use, links to manuals, or a contact person.''
*We want to help people keep the space organized.
::''Wiki pages should include the item home (where it belongs). That way, even new people can help keep the space organized simply by scanning items and putting them back in their home location.''

==Technical stuff for Windows users==
You may notice that some people use space.local instead of space.sudo, and some devices in the spaces only have .local hostnames. You will be ''unable to use .local addresses'', since Windows does not support the necessary &quot;Zero Configuration Networking&quot; (''&quot;zeroconf&quot;''). OS X ''does'' support zeroconf, though Apple calls it ''Bonjour''. '''You should be able to enable ''zeroconf'' support for Windows by installing [https://support.apple.com/kb/DL999 Apple's zeroconf for windows].''' The mysterious person who originally wrote this post can confirm that this works on Windows 7.

==Stuff without QR codes==

Not all things are labeled with QR codes.  Some need labels printed, others are better without.

* Dell Dimension DE051 (B110) - with XP SP3

===Additional===

====Maintenance====

There is going to be a maintenance and inventory of our existing electronics. (Suggested June 2013)
http://lists.sudoroom.org/pipermail/sudo-discuss/2013-June/002912.html

* Created an ethernet pad for this - https://pad.riseup.net/p/sudoroommaintenance

====3D Models of Objects====

Project to add 3D models of various objects in the SudoRoom. 

* Software - mobile software Autodesk 123Catch (anyone with a smartphone can scan a 3D object by taking up to 40 photographs of the object and stitching it up in the cloud) - very easy to use, even for beginners who don't know CAD at all 
* Hardware - eventually we'd like to get a 3D Scanner for SudoRoom 
* Hosting - We'd like to eventually host these models as STL files on our own servers
* Add these models as uploaded files or in-wiki files for each inventory item, tied to the QR codes as well that we scan</text>

In the past jack lent us his CNC mill which we used to cut wood. It was at the old SudoRoom. It is no longer at the SudoRoom but it left behind some awesome memories.

==Maintenance==
* Fairly self-maintaining
* Use a vaccuum while milling, especially with metal or large bits
* Bits can last for a while if treated with care, but aren't very expensive to replace--buy some for fun--but measure since our drill has a small chuck!
* Some items do require lubrication, but seldom
* Opening the lid along the x-axis and cleaning out debris is necessary from time to time
* Careful of hose connecting motor and drill housing, it can get tangled, require possible replacement (~$30)

==Components==
* Power supply
* USB to serial converter '''&quot;Smooth Stepper&quot;'''
* Stepper motor controller '''&quot;Gecko Drive&quot;'''
* Computer with operation software
** We use '''&quot;Mach3&quot;''' which seems to be the only software that works with our older hardware and the various other components. Unfortunately this requires windows
*** May want to experiment with running Mach3 in a VM.
** There is a range of available design software, but what seems to work well enough for CNC machines is '''CamBam Studio''', though it is not as nice as '''Sketchup'''
*** There are ways to import STL files into CamBam (also DXF, but they are screwy), but ultimately, care must be made for what type of milling is to be done.
*** To import STL files in CamBam select: Draw &gt; Surface &gt; From Mesh File. Then, select an STL file.

==Tutorials==
===Basic Example (wood sign)===
This tutorial seeks to demonstrate the existing tool-chain and a basic example of a project that a general sudoer could follow. If it fails in any fashion, please leave comments and make improvements. This is, after all, a wiki.

# Open '''CamBam''' and create a new file if necessary.
## If starting from an STL or DXF file, use the ''Draw &gt; Surface &gt; From Mesh File'' option or the ''File &gt; Import'' option respectively.
## Otherwise, you can design inside of CamBam, including insertion of text, which seems to use any font available in the fonts directory in the operating system.
## On the left-hand side of CamBam, there should be an odd list with folder icons. Select the '''&quot;Machining&quot;''' item with a folder icon. Below, you will see some settings available for configuration.
### At this point you should clamp the stock into place, then measure the exposed, cutting area. There is a small, open face wooden box that has different clamps, give them a try.
### In CamBam, set the &quot;Stock Size&quot; but think of this as the &quot;Cutting Area&quot; of whatever material you'd like to mill into. There are X, Y, and Z dimensions. '''Use millimeters''' it's apparently less buggy this way.
## Now you get to draw!
##* We used ''Draw &gt; Text'' and selected Palatino Linotype to make a sign for [[The Public School]].
##* Resize your drawing to fit the desired area, etc.
## Based on your drawing and the stock size, adjust the stock offset so it sits conveniently with your desired '''origin'''. This will be the place you center the mill later on, and should be a convenient place for ensuring the design is ultimately milled as intended. 
##* You may need to move the drawing, resize, or change its position offset again. 
## Select a '''Machining''' option from the ''Machining'' menu.
##* We used '''Pocket''' (''Machining &gt; Pocket'')to cut at an even depth with a width greater than the size of the bit itself.
##* You may create multiple '''&quot;Parts&quot;''' by disabling the part, then selecting another Machining option. This is handy when using multiple passes over the stock, such as with a big bit and a small bit to produce clean cuts. 
##* ''There are several forms of machining (milling) available that work differently: '''Profile''', '''Pocket''', '''Engrave''', '''3D Profile''', and '''Drill'''. Read the CamBam &quot;Help&quot; docs for more information.''
## Select the Machining Option item under your Part in the Machining settings for your current file (in that window on the left hand side). (E.g. we selected &quot;Pocket1&quot;).
##* Most important are '''Target Depth''', '''Roughing / Finishing''', '''Finish Stepover''', '''Roughing Clearance''', and '''Tool Diameter'''--especially the '''Target Depth''' and '''Tool Diameter'''. 
##** Use the digital calipers to measure the machining bit, especially if you're unsure of the size.
##* It is '''''strongly encouraged''''' to implement test cuts first, get a sense of the affect of different settings that will help you implement the milling to your desired specifications, especially with cutting rates.
## Finally, select ''Machining &gt; Generate Tool Paths'' and examine the resulting paths. Does this meet your desired outocome?
##* If not, adjust more settings until it does. This process can take a while depending on the complexity.
##* Especially adjust '''Roughing Clearance''' which can be given negative values to oversize holes.
## When you are confident in the tool path, generate gcode by selecting ''Machining &gt; Produce gcode''.
# Before turning anything else on, replace the bits if necessary using the drill key tool on the tool wall. 
# Turn on the power supply, located behind the monitor stand, in a hefty, vcr-looking black box. It's '''not''' a white switch, instead it looks similar to the switch on the back of a computer's power supply. 
# Also turn on the USB to serial converter using which '''is''' a white switch attached to a tiny black box in between the power supply and the mill. '''Down is on'''.
# Open Mach3
## Select ''File &gt; Load G-Code'' and select the desired gcode generated by CamBam or from elsewhere.
## Select the ''Reset'' button.
## Select the ''REF ALL HOME'' button.
##* These should set the position of the mill at a default state.
## Using the '''up''', '''down''', '''left''', '''right''' arrow keys, jog the drill along the X and Y axes above the desired origin. This will move the drill head and the platen with your stock attached.
## Once in a fairly close position, use the '''pgup''' and '''pgdn''' keys to ''carefully'' move the tip of the bit on the Z axis to just touching or just barely above the desired origin. 
##* '''Be careful''' not to move in the X and Y directions since this could break the bit. This is why the bit should be just above the stock when you set it as origin. 
## Now, with the bit in place select the '''Zero X''', '''Zero Y''', '''Zero Z''' buttons in order to set the origin by which your design will be milled.
## At this point, lift the bit up in the Z direction just a tad. Select '''Reset'''. Select '''Cycle Start &lt;Alt-R&gt;'''.
## If you're using text, or some image with a left-to-right or right-to-left orientation, it's likely that you will need to &quot;flip&quot; the image in order for it to be milled in the correct direction. Namely, setting the Scale for X to -1 did the trick for us.
## Finally, use the '''Regen. Toolpath''' button to ensure the newly set origin takes effect.
## When ready to begin, select '''Cycle Start''' button. Use the '''Feed Hold''' for pausing the process and '''Stop''' to end the process or in an emergency.
# Use the shopvac to vacuum up the debris as it mills.
# When making multiple passes and changing bits, you only need to re-adjust the zero (origin) for the Z axis--keeping the other two the same ensures perfect registration!
# Happy CNCing!

===Alternate Instructions===

it is composed of a few components:
* an internet connected desktop windows PC that runs special software: mach3 (icon on desktop)
* a hacked engraver that does the milling
* a stepper driver that sits between the PC and the engraver and communicates via parallel port

mach3 only accepts gcode. you can either use your own gcode or use the program on the PC called CamBam to generate the gcode.

Until we make better tutorials for CamBam please only use the CNC if you can get a CamBam tutorial from someone!

*'''NUTSHELL''' First a no-experience-necessary Sketchup class. Then an explanation and tutorial on how to use the 3D printer itself.
*'''INSTRUCTOR''' Max Klein aka [http://notconfusing.com notconfusing]

==Plan==
[[File:3DSketchupClass.jpg|500px]]
*Understand the workflow (Idea&gt;Design&gt;STL&gt;Slice&gt;Print).
*'''IDEA''' a miniature plate for canapes and appetizers that is ring and allows you to hold a drink in the same hand.
*'''DESIGN''' we'll make a 3d digital representation in sketchup
*'''STL''' gloss over this detail and leave it for another class
*'''SLICE''' gloss over this detail and leave it for another class
*'''PRINT''' marvel, and take home.
* ''Start a facebook group or mail list?''

==Learn==
On the right you'll see some examples of what I've 3D printed at sudo room, having learned all my skills at sudo room, from sudoers.
===Sketchup and Design===
*Introductions
**Level of 3d modelling experience (none required)
*3D Printing Theory
*Sketchup (many options, but this is easiest, not necessarily most powerful or precise)
**Navigation
***Zoom/Orbit/Pan
***Set views
**Basic Shapes
***Rectangle/Line/Circle/Polygon
***Precise measurements
**Shape Manipulation
***Push/pull
***Move vertice/edge
***Rotate
***Scale (
***Scale -1 Trick
***Offset
**Advanced Shapes
***Group
***Follow me
***Outershell
**Misc
***Tape/Erase
**Ready? Let's Make something. Learner's requests?
**Exporting

===Printing===
*Introductions
**Level of 3d modelling experience (none required), but you need a .stl file ready. (We make them in the earlier design portion of the class)
*Slic3r slicing software (in a minor way)
**Sometimes can need NetFabb fixing
*Repetier Host Printer Software (in a minor way)
*How to manually adjust the 3d printer in times of crisis.

==Bring==
*Come with a laptop with '''[http://www.sketchup.com/ sketchup] installed'''. There's a free version for Windows and Mac. If you don't have this installed, you cannot begin immediately.
*'''Bring a 3-button scroll mouse'''. Sketchup is much easier with a mouse, and all but impossible to learn with the track pad. '''Essential''', a mouse that has a clickable scroll-wheel.
*Bring '''your own .stl''' to print, if you are coming just for the second half.

=== Sudo Room Keypad Access ===

'''Press:'''

&lt;nowiki&gt;* YOURCODE # &lt;/nowiki&gt;
that is,
star, then your code, then pound

you can get a code by being a member.

== Hardware ==

* 4x4 Keypad
* Arduino
* DoorPi (Sudo Room's Rasberry Pi at the Outside Door)

== Software ==

* Arduino Code based on Noisebridge's keypad code modified for a 4x4 keypad ( https://gitorious.org/sudo-keypad-arduino/sudo-keypad-arduino )
* Code on RasPi, based on Noisebidge Baron.py ( https://gitorious.org/sudo-room-keypad-baron )
* Script is run from /root/sudoor/keypad on the RasPi
* the script is self-healing in that it can recover from having the usb-unplugged
* to avoid some other bugs the rpi reboots itself everyday at 5am.

== Adding/Managing Codes ==

* Codes are in /root/sudoor/keypad/codes.txt

At this time you must be root to add new codes. Next step is to add eaiser ways of adding codes, including being able to add onetime codes that expire for events</text>

Today, information is ownable. This entails a complex/costly system of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute statutory] regulations that attempt to prohibit the transmission of information and limit our powers of free speech in order to protect the financial interests of &quot;content owners&quot;.

There is a fundamentally different way, hereafter referred to as Kopimism, that is at odds with today's complex and self-defeating system of intellectual property. Kopimism is simpler, more efficient, and arguably better for everybody in the long run.

Kopimism is so good because it is in harmony with (and better exploits) the natural laws of reality. Information -- a dual of matter -- is intangible, inexhaustible, and illuminating. As matter wants to fall, information wants to be free. Kopimism takes advantage of these sacred (God given) properties of reality for the benefit of humanity.

We have an opportunity to introduce Kopimism to the mainstream by propagating this [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative normative] way and understanding of Kopimism that arrises from our understanding of reality. Our mission is to unite the factions and transition the world towards a society of complete information freedom through the transformation of our own way of being.


===== News =====

* Meeting Every Sunday at 1pm at Sudo Room [These are now defunct, rescheduling]
* Creation of ritual SudoRoom group chants and prayers in possible collaboration with the Public School Poetry Group
* Question for Dec 30th: What does Kopimism have to say about evesdropping secret channels? Why?


=== Ritual Chants ===

We are in serious need of revival. We will go through all the crazy American cult movements of the 20th century, &quot;kopimist&quot; what we can, and regroup by fusing with the Public School Poetry group and coming up with group ritual chants and prayers.

The Experimental Music group that meets will provide us with a variety of high-pitched 2400 baud modem sounds, and we will go from there.

=== Kopimism Hardware ===

[[File:800px-Scientology e-meter.jpg|100px|thumb|left|A Scientologist e-meter]]

We are currently kopimistically kopying the Scientologist e-meter. We are a the first phase of iterative agile modification. The process will be a lean, mean 3d printed additive manufacturing machine. Be aware that they are litigous, so this will be an opportunity to act with agility.

=== General Info ===

*  '''IRC''': ##kopimism (not #kopimism)
*  '''URL''': http://kopimism.org (not up yet)
*  '''Meeting''': At SudoRoom, Sunday afternoons at 1:00pm

===== Kopimist Credo =====

* I do not copyright my work nor patent my inventions, but publish them in the public domain unless I wish to keep them private
* I encourage others to copy/modify/publish/implement my work
* I give credit where it is due to the best of my ability
* I demand the right to copy/modify/publish/implement any information presented to me for anyone who wants it
* I respect the privacy of others


===== Discussion Points =====

* Copyright, Patents, and Trademarks
* DRM encoding/decoding
* Ethics, or what is not allowed
* California Pirate Party
* Radio wave regulations

===== Copyright and Licensing =====
Kopimists can use strategies to indicate when content is published under kopimist principles, but what options are there for dealing with existing copyright and licensing schemes? Should dual-licensing be used? Or CC-0 to approximate the public domain?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1659">This is a short guide on how to create a RAID 5 with an LVM filesystem on top and a LUKS encrypted volume on top of the LVM logical volume.

= Raid =

Create partitions on each drive with gdisk. Partition type is &quot;Linux RAID&quot;. Partition type code is FD00.

Create the raid 5 array:

 mdadm --create /dev/md1 --level=5 --raid-devices=10 /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1 /dev/sdf1 /dev/sdg1 /dev/sdh1 /dev/sdi1 /dev/sdj1 /dev/sdk1

Now set read-write mode (this will cause a resync):

 mdadm --readwrite /dev/md1

Manually add lines for new raid array to /etc/madadm.con
Run the following command to get lines:

 mdadm --examine --scan

= LVM =

Create physical lvm volume:

 pvcreate /dev/md1 # may be very very slow durin resync

Create volume group called 'sink':

 vgcreate sink /dev/md1 # slow during resync

Create logical lvm volume takin up 100% of free space with name 'sink':

 lvcreate -l 100%FREE sink -n data # slow during resync

You should now have:

 /dev/sink/data

and:

 /dev/mapper/sink-data

Now set up encryption:

 cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/sink/data

Open encrypted volume and create the filesystem:

 cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sink/data sink-data_crypt
 mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/sink-data_crypt # will take a long time if resync is in progress

= Mount on boot =

Get the UUID with:

 cryptsetup luksUUID /dev/sink/data

Then add this line to /etc/crypttab:

 sink-data_crypt UUID=&lt;the_uuid_from_previous_command&gt; none luks

Add this line to /etc/fstab:

 /dev/mapper/sink-data_crypt /data ext4 noatime 0 2

Your encrypted partition will now mount on boot. Be aware that your system will now require the passphrase in order to boot.</text>

=Protocol=

# A Sudo Room member qualifies for a locker if:
#* The member is in good standing (see [[Articles of Association]])
#* The member contributes a regular fee for use of the locker ([[Lockers#Locker Options|described below]])
#* The locker in question is not already in use by another member that qualifies as described above.
#* The member submits a request for a locker at a regular sudo room meeting.
# Exceptions to this protocol are made by consensus at a regular sudo room meeting.

==Locker Options==

* '''yellow''' (0/10 in use) - &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;'''$10'''&lt;/span&gt; / mo
** 19.5&quot; x 15.5&quot; x 14&quot; = '''4231.5 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 2.45 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
* '''gold''' (1/6 in use) - &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;'''$15'''&lt;/span&gt; / mo
** 16.5&quot; x 12&quot; x 35&quot; = '''6930 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 4 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
* '''green''' (5/6 in use) - &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;'''$20'''&lt;/span&gt; / mo
** 16.5&quot; x 16&quot; x 29.5&quot; = '''8260 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 4.78 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
* '''beige''' (7/10 in use) - &lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;'''$10'''&lt;/span&gt; / mo
** Sum of beige = '''5635 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 3.25 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''
** &quot;|&quot; part of &quot;L&quot; - 17.5&quot; x 4.5&quot; x 42&quot; = 3307.5 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 1.9 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
** &quot;_&quot; part of &quot;L&quot; - 5.5&quot; x 17.5&quot; x 6&quot; = 577.5 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 0.33 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
** footlocker part - 17.5&quot; x 10&quot; x 10&quot; = 1750.0 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; ~ 1 ft&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

===Estimates of Locker Income===

* At current usage, sudo room should receive:
** (1*15) + (5*20) + (7*10) = '''$185 / month'''
* At capacity, sudo room should be able to receive:
** (10*15) + (6*15) + (6*20) + (10*10) = '''$460 / month'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2050">= 3D Printing an MRI at SudoRoom Project =

As with software engineering, it is always best to learn how to do stuff that you are emotionally involved in.
Who isn't interested in their MRIs? If not their own, their relative's MRIs. Sometimes the MRIs are sad. Sometimes they are happy. One guy even saved his wife's sight by 3D printing her MRI ([http://makezine.com/magazine/hands-on-health-care/ distracting but fun link] - promise not to surf away!). , 

== Upload your MRI ==


We'd like to get a database of people uploading their MRIs.
You can do this by clicking on Upload File on the left side of the wiki.

= Status = 

This is a cool project, people were donating MRIs. 

Here's al anding page: would be nice to get outsiders and new people interested in this. 
Also write a short tutorial on how to &quot;do this yourself&quot; but at SudoRoom

http://sudoroom.github.io/MRI-Art-Landing-Page/



= Caveats = 

= 3D Printing is so cool it's always distracting =
3D Printing is one of those endeavors where people tend to spend too much time surfing the web for neat projects. There are so many interesting stories out there, and I notice that compared to other projects this is one to hose where people get wrapped up in surfing the web the most. The 3D modelling software is the most time consuming and although easy, it's very easy to get distracted, especially if you are just here on your free time.

= Project =

Turn these notes into a blog post. &lt;3
There are instructables and so on but most normal people will spend a lot of time getting distracted and have to spend time getting into the downloading all the stuff.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2095">= Konica Minolta Magicolor 2530DL =

A networked color laser printer.

== Printing from Linux ==

===From Ubuntu===
Go to printing and add a new network printer. It should detect the printer on the network after a few seconds and let you install it without any issues.

===From Other, or Troubleshooting===
If the printer cannot be detected or does not work, follow these steps:

* Download the latest version [http://foo2lava.rkkda.com/ foo2lava] which has full instructions -- I did the following:
*: &lt;code&gt;$ wget -O foo2zjs.tar.gz http://foo2zjs.rkkda.com/foo2zjs.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt;
*: &lt;code&gt;$ tar -zxf foo2zjs.tar.gz&lt;/code&gt; *Note there's a typo on the original instructions
*: &lt;code&gt;$ make&lt;/code&gt;
*: &lt;code&gt;$ make install&lt;/code&gt;
*: &lt;code&gt;$ ./getweb 2530&lt;/code&gt; # Get Konica Minolta magicolor 2530 DL .ICM files (PICK 
*: &lt;code&gt;$ make&lt;/code&gt;
*: &lt;code&gt;$ sudo make cups&lt;/code&gt;
*: &lt;code&gt;$ system-config-printer&lt;/code&gt; # Or use other option on [http://foo2lava.rkkda.com/ foo2lava]
*: &quot;For a networked Konica Minolta magicolor 2530 DL, I used a &quot;Queue Type&quot; &quot;HP JetDirect&quot; and set &quot;Host:&quot; to the IP address of the printer and &quot;Port:&quot; to 9100.&quot;

== Printing from Windows ==

On Windows 7 64-bit, the printer is not found automatically nor by IP. Factotum could not get it to work; tried the following:
* [[http://onyxftp.mykonicaminolta.com/Download/SearchResults.aspx?productid=965 Download driver]] (tried both vista 64-bit and regular windows 7 (only 32 bit exists)
* Installing. Choose network printer. Found the printer on the network. Selected the printer. Error message: &quot;Could not connect to printer&quot; (or something like that)
* Firewall etc. was disabled.

== Printing from OSX ==

writeme

== Problems ==

The printer sometimes has problems using the paper if there are only a few sheets left. It will say something like &quot;paper jam&quot; even though there is no actual paper jam. Just add more paper, then open the top of the printer and close it again.

The printer sometimes says something about an incorrect black cartridge. We don't know what it means but it does not seem to affect performance.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17899">The concept of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidarity_economy solidarity economy] is supporting and only buying from flat economies. A collective is based on any participation without hierarchies, a cooperative is member participation without hierarchies. Since the ''means to exist'' (land, water, etc.) should be equal to all, collectives are usually spaces without hierarchy. Meanwhile, the forming of products, as a ''means to survive'' are usually cooperative decisions by those producing the product, or workers. The solidarity economy expands from the currencies of capitalism when the collectives and cooperatives buy only from flat economy, but sell to the capitalistic economy. 

The concept of a mass effect is comparable to a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_line mass line], except a mass line is the formation of organizations in protest, or opposition, to another organization (business, state, etc.), while a mass effect are collectives and cooperatives coming together to share or exchange their resources in their own associations. A collective event for cooperatives and collectives to form these associations.

=Associations=

These are proposed or existing ideas between cooperatives and collectives with their own articles of association (by-laws). These are non-binding associations, but a means to establish interest in these ideas. 

===Collective of Collectives===

* [http://www.omni-oakland.org/ The Omni] opened July 1st 2014. It's a collective that consists of Bay Area Public School, Sudo Room, Counter Culture Labs, Timeless, Infinite Light, Oakland Nights Live, Backspace, Food Not Bombs, Omni Dance, and more.
* [http://aplaceforsustainableliving.org/ People Linking Art Community and Ecology (PLACE)] is a collective that consists of Spokeland, Fab Lab, Vessel Bikes, Treewolf, and more. It was a project inspired by the [http://www.sustainablelivingroadshow.org/ Sustainable Living Roadshow].

===Other Spaces===

The idea of forming a collective of collectives regardless of the space. There are a [https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Spaces number of spaces] that have been considered.

===Exchanges===

Other than sharing a space together, the collectives are making [https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Collective_Exchanges exchanges without any money].

=Events= 

We will be having quarterly events, updating and highlighting ideas and effects in the community.

= Math at SudoRoom =

We have a surprising number of Mathematicians in our hackerspace. Many of our programmers are mathematically oriented. Even weirder, many stay true to math instead of programming and even prefer to do calligraphy and art over coding. It's like entering a time machine.

== History == 

The early days of SudoRoom at the old location in downtown Oakland were started with morning math sessions. I frankly find it unusual to find math for pure pleasure and outside of the context of teaching little kids. What a novelty! Those people are still here so maybe we can star this again. 

= Math Projects =

== Sidwalk Art Lessons ==

In 2015 Anthony Repetto left a beautiful graph theory problem in chalk near SudoRoom.

== [[Math_Literacy]] ==

We are building a team of teachers and students to teach and learn math! 

== Math Library ==

We have some hardcore math library books. 

== Old / no longer active ==

=== Morning Math Project ===
[[Morning_math]] Morning math was a rolling event at SudoRoom where attendees could create an anxiety-free zone to discuss and share mathematics

==== Morning Math Projects ====

* [[Morning math/Voting systems]] - Questioning the assumption of &quot;one person, one vote&quot; and an introduction to mathematical modeling.
* [[Morning math/Mathematical Reasoning]] - Introduction to basic logic, proofs, and abstract mathematics. The essential guide to a budding mathematician (of any disposition).
* [[Morning math/Science]] - Considering the fundamental mathematical/philosophical notions of science.
* [[Morning math/Forays in Logic]] - A casual engagement with some topics of logic. The nature of these topics may not be clear for newcomers, but do not be dissuaded if it seems advanced, initial reactions are helpful too.
* [[Morning math/Information]] - The theory (mainly mathematical) of Information and similar concepts.
* [[Morning_math/Models]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2442">= McHawking Wheelchair Robot @ Sudo Room =

== Technical Details ==

* For the most recent (but possibly incorrect and/or contradictory) technical information please refer to the [http://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Noise-Bot Noise-Bot page on the Noisebridge Wiki]

* For information about the original hack which converted the electric wheelchair into the McHawking robot, please see the [http://www.instructables.com/id/Brain-Controlled-Wheelchair/ Brain-Controlled Wheelchair document on Instructables.com]

* For information on the open source DORA bot project (which was applied to the last iteration of the McHawking hardware) please [http://www.dorabot.com/ visit the project website]

== Network ==

* You can SSH into McHawking if you are physically located at Sudo Room and connected to the &quot;sudoroom&quot; wireless access point

* IP Address: 192.168.1.5 (details on the '''[http://sudoroom.org/wiki/Network Sudo Room Network Page]''')

* username: mchawking
* password: [redacted]

== Software ==

*'''[https://code.google.com/p/mchawking/ Google Code repository]'''

*'''[https://puzzlebox.info/robotics Puzzlebox Robotics tracker (for Brain-Control)]'''

== Operating Instructions ==

* Change to the &quot;lilia&quot; directory int he &quot;mchawking&quot; account's home directory (&quot;/home/mchawking/lilia&quot;)

* Execute the &quot;controller.py&quot; Python script (&quot;./controller.py&quot;)

* At this point you can operate McHawking

 commands:
 i j k l to move, SPACE = stop, x = quit
 s d f g or 0-9 to adjust speed between 0 and 255.

* First set a speed setting by typing a number from 0-9 on the keyboard. &quot;5&quot; is a good number for getting started

* Then press down and hold a key to start McHawking moving. &quot;i&quot; is for forward (where &quot;forward&quot; means in the direction of the monitor. If you were sitting in the original seat of the wheelchair this would actually be &quot;backward&quot;)

* If the wheelchair doesn't drive check to see that the light on the manual joystick is active. Move the joystick briefly in any direction and you should hear the wheel controller click as it engages. Now try to drive again via software.

== Hardware ==

* There is a yellow wire going to a screw terminal on the Arduino which controls power to the computer. This is a safety mechanism and will force a hard reboot when terminal connection is lost by the Arduino (including during normal software exit). Unscrew this cable when uploading new firmware to the Arduino.

* '''4. amendments to the compact'''
* To draft changes to the Articles of Association, http://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association/Draft and new can be created by copying the article's wikitext and pasting into any new sub-page such as this one: http://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association/Matt_had_an_idea
* &lt;br /&gt;
* The canonical copy (to be updated as we go, from drafts) is here: http://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association

&lt;br /&gt;

* Amendment Proposal: Issue of items &quot;loaned&quot; to the space - do we want to have a written policy on this? (MK)
* discussion: what are expectations? get expectations in writing as a solution on case by case basis?
* challenge: safety, security of the object(s), owner needing access to it a certain amount of the time
* experience from labitat: only accept for indefinite loans, ok if it breaks, and req. a certain amount of notification time before requiring it to be given back.
** &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

* '''6. conflict resolution'''
** meta-suggestion: a third party to help arrange two potential conflicting parties in identifying &quot;a consenting, neutral, mutually agreed-upon third-party.&quot;

&lt;br /&gt;

* Possibly some discussion of what relationship the irc channel &quot;#sudoroom&quot; on freenode has to the organization, the space, and the compact.

&lt;br /&gt;

* Timon
* &lt;br /&gt;
* The complaint:
* On more than one occasion, Timon has acted aggressively and behaved in a threatening manner. On one occasion, in the middle of the night, Timon refused to leave the space and made Jenny feel unsafe. On an earlier, unrelated occasion Marc felt unsafe when Timon approached him and spoke to him aggressively.�

*** We railroaded through this before anyone could speak...
*** This conflict was articulated at the last meeting and we tabled the decision-making process in order to practice fairness, enable further possible conflict resolution, and get additional necessary perspectives from Timon:
**** On more than one occasion, Timon has acted aggressively and behaved in a threatening manner. On one occasion, in the middle of the night, Timon refused to leave the space and made Jenny feel unsafe. On an earlier, unrelated occasion Marc felt unsafe when Timon approached him and spoke to him aggressively.
*** Timon explains himself, feels misunderstood and explains circumstances around why he was on-edge - and that Jenny was too extreme in threating.
*** After hearing Timon's perspective, the group informally straw-polled at 12-0-1 votes to table making a decision on this issue until the next meeting, at which point potential resolutions can be proposed and we can then use a particular decisions procedure that fits the resolution on the table.

*** '''Tabled for later discussion: '''Asking, respectfully, that similar behavior to those described in the complaints be not reproduced again in sudo room.
**** Complaints:
***** [The previously articulated and noted conflicts from mtg 1 of this process]: On more than one occasion, Timon has acted aggressively and behaved in a threatening manner. On one occasion, in the middle of the night, Timon refused to leave the space and made Jenny feel unsafe. On an earlier, unrelated occasion Marc felt unsafe when Timon approached him and spoke to him aggressively.
****** Specifically: Raising one's voice to the point of drowning out another's voice, aggressive/angry responses to nonaggressive requests, intoxication to the point of not being able to control anger/aggression

** Feedback from Anthony
*** context is that conflict resolution felt less satisfactory
*** the process dragged on, needed to be more timely
*** wants some one to be responsible for keeping track of each step of the process
*** In the same way that the facilitator or exchequer exist to keep an eye on process
** attributes little to the conflict resolution process being a first time it was implemented
*** and we can't anticipate on that experience
**** process should not be based on informal opinions, but based on documentation
** Tom: Using small numbers of people is always preferable.
** Ray: Suggestion for conflict resolution trainings.
** Oracle: will send some notes and a possible resolution via email
*** have communal peace maker in each group
*** once a month core group outings to build consciousness on working together
** Hol: willing to try it out :)
** Anthony: point person can help people identify who to speak with when they have a problem
** Xavier: suggestion for process to go around the room for a particular conflict and identify the person who is least invested in it. that person could be a facilitator. also suggestion to require conflict resolution training and/or knowledge of the conflict resolution process as a prerequisite of membership.
* creation of the constabulary role
** the point person who is responsible for facilitating the conflict resolution process, but not necessarily the moderator.
** please see the draft articles above for further details on the responsibilities of the role

&lt;br /&gt;'''Discussion items + overflow'''&lt;br /&gt;

* Safety in and outside of the space
** Cars broken into outside
** Bike taken from common room

&lt;br /&gt;'''conflict resolution'''&lt;br /&gt;

Fiscal Solvency

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlKk2X9KKqlFdFZJUy12ZUhDUmx2N3hUZldyejlXdFE#gid=7

    Monthly Expenses: $1750

    If we wanted to come in to filling a small portion of the standing funds: membership funds of $80

    Marc suggests having smaller dues, ammenable by Matt's suggestion to offer an array or options, making it clear that $80 is the calculated amount based on costs

    Do a survey of the email list to ask about donation preferences

Amendments to the compact

    ?

conflict resolution
Suggestions:

    Community asset mapping (list of skills and interests)

    Buddy-system schedulers (meta-level suggestion) -- Take on tasks and ask for a buddy to coordinate acting on that action item.

* Space / New Space / The Search Continues (15 min)
** Priorities / valuesÂ 
*** Historical / Previous requirements for any potential space are listed here: https://sudoroom.org/wiki/page/Sudo_room/open_a_space
**** Please note that those are from last year and is in need of updates.
** Update on tour of space on 19th and Franklin last Thurs (Jenny, Ray, ?) http://sfbay.craigslist.org/eby/off/3734928687.htmlÂ 
*** $0.95/sqft (we are currently paying $2/sqft - though does not include common space)
** Strategy
*** UseÂ  http://hackerspaces.crowdmap.com/ (ask Romy or Matt for admin access)
* Bike Smut: thoughts on drinks; safe space/glow worms
** There is an organization we know that has an abundance of beer. Fundraising opportunity exists here.
*** A permit is needed in order to sell alcohol. Our landlord is flexible, but will almost certainly require a permit if we want to sell beer.
*** A non-permit option is to give free beer and ask for donations.
** Ray has produced aphrodisiac ice cream in the past. Would be able to make it.
** Glow Worms: Concept from co-ops. People designated at event who wear glow in the dark wrist/headbands for easy identification. The glow worms act as ambassadors who help participants at large events with any q's (where bathrooms are, etc.) and help if anyone has any problems with safety, happiness, etc.
* Subiir: Next meeting
** Beer is being made every three weeks. Meet at 10/11AM to brew and ferment beer. Then we come to sudo, drink the beer from three weeks, bottle the beer from three weeks ago. Next Wed. is the next cycle. 80 bottles of beer. This will be donation based!
* Cerebot Dev boards for everyone to play with!
** Wolfy has a big box of 5 Cerebots. They are free for sudo room.
* Tshirts
** We are out of them!
** How can we fund a new print run?
**

    Specifically could get $ from burners

    Not necessarily easy while in our current, less-developed state

    Donated equipment

    Repair and sell, e.g. on Ebay - suggestion by Eddan

    Re-use and sell or sell as services

    Similar potential to http://spokeland.org/

    DIY ISP ++ 

    a la http://ranchwifi.com/

    Laci Videmsky has offered to host a workshop on how to do this, like he and his business partner did with Ranch Wifi

    Kits

    electronics - (i won't be at the meeting tonight but if we come up with a few and order the components in bulk and package individually together, we can sell at events - Hol)

    Home PCs for cheapz

    Art kits

    Writing kits

    Kits of kits :D ^.^ ^.^

    Kits of 3D printers that create other kits

    Non-profit status

    Tax-deductable Donations as a 501(c)3

    Noisebridge and School Factory have offered to provide fiscal sponsorship

    School Factory has a lot more experience than NB in fiscal sponsorship

    Grants

    Regular events

    Raves

    Speaker events - of particular relevance to our projects

    Covers? No covers?

    NOTES

    Len - from a business standpoint there are two different funding mechanisms at play here

    One is internal funding, the other is coming from external sources

    You can also look at things as &quot;products&quot; or &quot;not products&quot; the technology may or may not be there.

    Examine the who / what / where / when / why, and the time / effort involved -- you can cross most of it out

    Jenny

    Added speaker events section

    In particular, UC Berkeley wifi groups are excited about sudo, would possibly be interested in speaking here

    Tommy

    We would want to do some of these things regardless of whether or not they brought in income

    Sam

    Art Murmur membership could provide us space to sell things. Bill

    Eddie

    Internet security, in NY times two days ago - information security as a service we could offer.

==Security== 
*George (and James) https://sudoroom.org/wiki/DefensiveHacking

*Chance of a general robbery of sudoroom
*&quot;Apple picking&quot;
*Door was unlatched - do not ever unlatch the door! - if door jiggles, it needs to be latched 

===Strategies===

== Real Estate / Alternative Real Estate ==
*New space discussion (with Tim)
*Tim:

=Amendments to the Articles of Association=

=Conflict Resolution=

=Discussion Spillover= 
*desire for folks to help with sudo kids
**we are looking for people to help do activities (we have only been doing clay and radio so far) on tuesday nights. do you have an idea for something you'd like to do with kids? if so, contact ray or marina.
**join sudo kids list: 
*desire for folks to help with radio
**we are starting to get shows booked! are you interested in helping train people, book shows, generally expand the radio program? if so, please contact marina!
*space.sudo/music is down!
**this also affects sudo radio as mixxx, our dj software, typically connects to the music server and seems to not want to do anything when the server is down.

==access &amp; membership==
*proposal to use the following membership/access procedure:
**tell people to sign up to become members on our site: https://sudoroom.org/membership/
**when people sign up, they should come to the space where a member will:
**check the results of the membership sign-up form to ensure that the person is on there: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AlKk2X9KKqlFdFZJUy12ZUhDUmx2N3hUZldyejlXdFE#gid=6
**the membership sign-up form results are on the last tab of our fiscal solvency sheet!
**give them a code for door.sudoroom.org
**let them know that if there are any problems, that the code can be revoked
**let them know about dues, the sliding scale, and different ways to contribute (sudoroom.org, gittip, via check or cash in the dropbox (show location of the dropbox) or during wednesday meetings).
**give them instructions on how to open and close the space.
**invite them to listservs and wednesday night meetings
**give them logins for wordpress site &amp; wiki (not everyone knows how to do this)

==Need to do==
*Give existing sudoers ability to add pw's for new people. Jordan is working on adding commenting to the txt file that houses our list of pw's. Once this is done, 
*We currently have no way to track or report who pays, etc. Is this ok? If not, we need solutions.
*If you want to work on membership management solutions, check out this repo: https://github.com/substack/sudo-members
*A number of folks have signed up to be members but it's unclear whether they have had any follow-up or come by the space. we've updated the info on the page that confirms that someone completed the form completely to let people know that they should come to the space, but should we contact the folks who have already signed up?

=Conflict Resolution=
*On Saturday night, a person who'd been asked by several members to leave after physically assaulting a sudoer in the space, who'd failed to engage with the conflict resolution process and had shown up several times since, was ushered from the space by a number of sudo room and public school members. In-meeting consensus is to ban Ariel from 2141 Broadway, with one week's notice for a final consensus to be reached next week. 
*We now have no way to get in contact with Tabitha, Arielle's sister, since Tabitha gave Arielle her phone. 

=Discussion Spillover= 
*New space options / possible CCL collaboration: https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Space
*General sense of sudoroom's values:
  1. Appreciation for the existing assets and resources existent in sudo room (eg common space)
  2. Excellent opportunity to collaborate with Counter Culture Labs to share space (economy of scale)
  3. Excellent opportunity to continue collaborating with the Public School
  4. MORE AUTONOMY. ALWAYS.  
* Sudo-kids on thin ice
** Assumption that sudo kids vandalized the space. People kept drawing penises in the bathroom.
** &quot;Children (under 18) should not be in the space except when accompanied by their parent(s) with advance notice to us.&quot;
** 
  1. Address the bathroom vandalism issue and disambiguate it.
  2. We have a family-oriented night with adult supervision, which would occur regularly on Tuesdays. We require that all children be here with parent supervision. 
  3. How do we remain accessible to people of all age groups?
  4. If there is a regular kids/family event, someone needs to assume responsibility (ambiguous?)</text>

* Giving 3 months notice to landlord?
** What action?
** Proposal: it's not necessary for us to deal with unreasonable people.
** Proposal:
*** Sudo room to reflect consensus that it is interested in moving in together more formally with the public school, and counter culture labs whether at 2141 broadway or elsewhere.
*** Convene this Friday to draft a set of collective requirements for our shared space.
**** https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Sudo_room/open_a_space
*** Hack membership with a team
**** Matt will be point person: mattsenate@gmail.com
*** Hack real estate with a team
**** Marc will be point person: marcjc@gmail.com
* Staying where we are in current arrangement
** Need to drop Eddan from lease
** Month-to-month
** Renegotiate?
*** Long-term?
*** Need to renegotiate anyhow to drop Eddan
** Full Rental of commonspace floor.
** Simplest option is money.
** Mitigatibles
*** Negotiation
*** Access policy for members and the public (security)
**** Doing this before any meeting will make the negotiation go better
*** Rent the whole floor
**** Bring in other tenants, more stakeholders
**** Is this possible?
***** Sudo room should be expanding and not contracting! - Jordan
***** Shouldn't expect that we need absolutely greater space, could find a similarly sized option that is sudo room's best interest
****** More active spaces, stations
****** Common space may be negative
******* Perhaps it's possible to have large event spaces accessible for a small number of hours elsewhere
******* &lt;br /&gt;
****** It's not even clear where we are--more visibility is an asset, street-level access?
******* Could be a double-edged sword
****** Safety of being alone can be an issue
****** Sunlight and fresh air are important
*** Paying extra money, deposit, longer term lease
**** Is there any amount of money that will make George and Laurie feel secure and satisfied?
***** Jordan thinks this accurately represents their position in these circumstances
**** May feel wrong, or be a bad deal
*** Anthony (or anyone) could clean, i.e. vaccuum, dishes, etc
**** Pay for janitorial service
*** Is George personally mitigatible?
*** Requirement for landlord entrance (24 notice, etc)
** Want to move quickly on this issue
** Meeting?
*** Who/what/where/when/why?
*** Methodology
**** Separate people from the problem
**** Focus on interests not positions
**** Invent options for mutual gain
**** Insist on using objective criteria
*** Other tips
**** Agree with folks valid points and present clearly acceptable improvements
***** Re-iterate concerns about security, propose changes
****** Take changes akin to David's, send them to sudo list.�
* Another option is to find a /particular/ Space to move in to
** Eddie Che points out that this is a pretty good space.
* Future option: buy a building
** Use California law as shared venture or the new federal JOBS act

&lt;br /&gt;Fire last night? Anthony was like, it's all good, but be aware there are some hazards with gratings on the sidewalk outside the first floor. Connects to wood underneath the building. Firecode?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

* Hey all,
* &lt;br /&gt;
* I spoke with Laurie for a while the other day re: the usual tenant/landlord problems, namely, building security and common-area/bathroom cleanliness.�
* &lt;br /&gt;
* Out of this discussion I have two proposals to bring to SUDO and BAPS, regarding these two issues.
* &lt;br /&gt;
* I should preface what follows by saying, the meat of whats proposed here involves improvements to the building infrastructure by us, and for the most part taking on responsibilities that George and Laurie as landlords should really be responsible for, but will not do. This is unfair, exploitative, even galling, but the reality IMO is that things have escalated to a point that I think if we want to remain in the building, and not fight every day with george threatening eviction blah blah blah, we just have to be the grown-ups here and take care of business by hacking these problems into oblivion so we can focus on our own shit. It's clear to me anyway that no one will fix these issues but us, so:
* &lt;br /&gt;
** '''Proposal #1 - access/security:'''
** &lt;br /&gt;
** '''New(?) security policy:'''�
** &lt;br /&gt;
** The last person to leave SUDO/BAPS area, or the last person there if you are crashing there, will:
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - Check all the 2nd floor bathrooms, hallways and stairs for people before leaving / turning in. The person bottomlining any BAPS class that gets out in the evenings, should always do this before leaving, even if there are still people at SUDO.
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - Make sure the top-of-the-stairs door by the bathrooms is deadbolted before leaving at night
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - Ask anyone you don't personally recognize what's up with them / who they are when leaving at night
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - If you are bottomlining an event at night, make sure you are the last one of those attending to leave, or that someone from SUDO/BAPS is still there to follow the above policies in your stead..
** &lt;br /&gt;
** '''New / fix security infrastructure:�'''
** &lt;br /&gt;
** '''&lt;nowiki&gt;* What should happen, but won't&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;: George should install a professional intercom and working keypad entry system for the other 2nd-floor tenants that rely on the 22nd St door, and augment security to the top-of-stairs door by the bathrooms.�&lt;/nowiki&gt;
** &lt;br /&gt;
** '''&lt;nowiki&gt;* What we can do instead&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;:�&lt;/nowiki&gt;
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - Hack together '''intercom/door-buzz system''' for the 2 other tenants that rely on 22nd st, as we have done at SUDO.�
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - Fix the '''keypad entry''' so it doesn't break everyday, involving: fabricate a chassis for the unit, secure it and all cabling up off the ground to the wall, and patch whatever software may be malfunctioning on the unit. (Who set this up?)
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - Also secure the new desktop PC down there controlling the street-facing '''webcam''' and its cabling to the wall off the floor, and eventually make the cam feed accessible to the other 2 building tenants. (Who set this up?)
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - '''Top-of-stairs door''' adjacent to the bathrooms: Modify/replace door handle lockset to one which always locks - ie, is always locked from the outside, but always openable from the inside, and cannot be left unlocked unless it is propped open. In addition, install a door-closer at the top of the door.�
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - Install GoogleVoice / SIP # to the computer/kiosk by the elevator, that George/Laurie can call to get ahold of whoever is there, that we should all keep an ear out for and answer. Right now they have a hard time doing this, since the population of on-site SUDO/BAPS members shifts, ie there is not just one person they can call.�
** &lt;br /&gt;
** Laurie will pay for cost of parts in the above proposed changes, provided it is not 1000s of dollars...but obviously not the labor we put into it, I don't think.
** &lt;br /&gt;
** Note with the above changes, SUDO/BAPS folks will always use the elevator. Everyone else, such as the other tenants on the 2nd floor that use the 22nd st entrance, will buzz people in via the intercom, then walk to the top-of-the-stairs door near the bathrooms, and let people in. And the 22nd St door will remain locked most all of the time.
** &lt;br /&gt;
** '''Proposal #2''' '''- Cleanliness in shared areas.'''
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - '''Before''' any big events at SUDO/BAPS, whoever is bottomlining the event should stock the bathrooms with '''extra TP'''. I am going to ask Laurie to pay for the TP or include it in our utilities etc., and that it be stored in a space we can get to.
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - '''After''' any big events, the persons bottomlining it check the bathrooms before leaving and:
** - empty the trash�
** - replace any missing / run-out TP so the rest of the tenants the next morning can still wipe their asses
** - If there is a shitstorm in one of the bathrooms (a la the fecal swastika's of last week), clean it up, and pull in people to help you as needed.
** &lt;br /&gt;
** - When the trash fills up in our space, take the trash bag and the key to the trashroom/roll-up door in the alley, empty it, and put in a fresh bag. There are two keys for the trash room, one in SUDO room and one in BAPS (both hanging on a hook on the wall.) Trash bags are found under the sink in the common area, as well as in SUDO room. Note there are also small bags for the compost containers.
** &lt;br /&gt;
** That's it.. there are some questions regarding who will be responsible for maintaining the security infrastructure once it's installed -if we wanted that to be us, we will charge George and Laurie for that (get money taken off our rent.)
** &lt;br /&gt;
** Anyway, let me know what you think -
** &lt;br /&gt;
** Best,
** David

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9806">= Emails between Eddan and Marc =

I'm not sure where the meeting notes for this meeting went, but I originally submitted this as part of the meeting notes and so now I'm putting it here as the only remaining part of the meeting notes since it seems like no other meeting notes were logged to the wiki. ([[User:Juul|Juul]] ([[User talk:Juul|talk]]))

In the following the emails are annotated with headlines and my comments (not part of the original emails) are annotated in parentheses. ([[User:Juul|Juul]] ([[User talk:Juul|talk]]))

= Eddan's PostScript Note on the Misleading Portrayal of this Incident =

It is worth noting that the email Marc sent to the CCL list was intentionally talking behind another member's back since Eddan is not on the CCL list. The direct insults, purposeful exclusion, and total misunderstanding of what was actually going on - should also be considered.
I had only seen this page a while after it was written up. 
Another example of misleading, one-sided presentation of issues.
This is bad faith.
- Eddan

== Marc's Final Email Non-Apology ==

This was the last thing Marc said about this issue on the mailing list. Before you read any of the crap back and forth - one should understand that Marc was completely mistaken about what was said, how it was said, and what it meant.



Ok. I understand if you want to be taken off the lease. I was trying to figure out if I had missed some collective decision-making around this issue, since I didn't realize if we'd directly made the decision to terminate the lease (did we? i'm still not clear on that?).

I feel that maybe it would have been a good idea to send a quick note to the list like &quot;hey i'm planning to terminate sudo room's lease for these reasons&quot;, but no harm done. We were going to renegotiate the lease anyway, and almost certainly before the date you gave the landlords for sudo-lease termination.
 
-- 
Marc

== For what was actually going on ==

this is from di Franco &amp; Hol on the mailing list.

To try to help answer the question of what exactly happened and what the implications are, let me quote from Eddan's email, emphasis mine (archived here):

“Terminating the current lease means the latter, David. That is - at that point, a new/better lease can be negotiated. Or not, if so decided. While the details on what a co-op purchase would look like still have to be hammered out in detail, it was my understanding from George that he was interested in an arrangement that would include selling off equity in that portion. Different organizations would put up money in their collective shares and that wing would be organized as a co-op with the different organizational/individual owners taking part in the decision-making of managing the building.”

and from Hol's email, (archived here):
“I think we've been fortunate to have people (Eddan, Matt, Zach) put their name down in the lease and assume a degree of liability for operations. I interpret the notice to George as a move that is not binding on sudo room in any way, but one that A) allows Eddan and presumably Matt to relinquish their &quot;doing business as&quot; status to a better defined group, B) informs George that his behavior toward tenants will not be met with guaranteed continued tenancy, and C) puts a fire under all of our asses to solve the space/access/community issues elegantly, either by finding a new space or by coming to an agreement and a way forward at 2141. These are just my thoughts, with a grain of salt on specifics as I haven't been going to general meetings recently but I guess it's time to start doing that again since this is a matter of great importance.”


== From me, on sudo room list ==
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; I've given notice to George &amp; Laurie that we are terminating
&gt; the current lease at the end of December. 
&gt; George said he was interested in putting up the 
&gt; Sudo Room section of the building for co-op sale.

Did sudo room agree to do this or did you just decide to go out and do this on your own?

(It seems that sudo room did not agree. This is a problem.)
&lt;/pre&gt;
== From me, on Counter-culture labs list ==
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; I think your concerns are valid, Matt.  
&gt; But before we assuming that we're in a situation where 
&gt; good money follows bad, we should prolly do some 
&gt; due diligence and figure out what's really going on 
&gt; with an in-person meeting with Eddan and Matt and 
&gt; perhaps even (god forbid) a meeting with George 
&gt; and Laurie as well as a follow on.  

(So now CCL folks got very confused, because terminating the
 lease goes against what we'd agreed to pursue with them
 at the tri-group meeting.)

I want to chime in real quick with an important note: 
Please don't assume that Eddan is in any position of 
leadership or decision-making power in sudo room. 
He is not active in sudo room, nor has he been doing 
anything for or with sudo room for the past several months, 
except to show up for the past few meetings and make 
unrealistic suggestions about buying the whole 
building where sudo room is currently located.

(CCL folk were assuming that Eddan was a person to talk to
 about what sudo room is and will be doing. 
 This is a problem, since Eddan has just shown that he is
 somewhat disconnected from the reality of the situation.)

(Now come the emails from Eddan.
 I did not reply privately, and made only one reply on the list. 
 which is included at the end.)
&lt;/pre&gt;
== private email to me from Eddan ==
&lt;pre&gt;
Sorry if I misunderstood you, Marc. But you'll remember from 
the last several meetings that despite efforts to mitigate 
the issue with George, you said emphatically that there was 
no way you were OK with having to deal with George. 
I pressed you on it, several times, and you were clear 
about your dissent veto of any other effort. 

Also, over the last 3 meetings, as noted in the minutes, 
it was decided to remove individuals (such as myself) 
from the lease. I am totally on favor of this, 
primarily because of the multiple times Jenny 
has attacked me about this aggressively.

Can't have it both ways, Marc.
&lt;/pre&gt;
== sudo-discuss email from Eddan ==
&lt;pre&gt;
It was also based on your emphatic veto on any mitigating 
solution that involved any contact with our landlord in 
the last several meetings. As well as the decision, 
trailing back to three consecutive meetings, where it 
was decided to remove individual names for the lease.

My apologies if I misunderstood you, Marc. I assumed 
you were being sincere.

(I never vetoed anything)
&lt;/pre&gt;
== private email to me from Eddan ==
&lt;pre&gt;
how dare you!?!

the only reason i have not been coming around lately is 
because you and Jenny have explicitly made me feel 
unwelcome and have threatened me over and over again.
the last straw was when jenny made up some pathological 
scenario at a bar and told the bartender that i was 
harassing her after she started yelling at me.
i am planning to bring this up at this week's meeting 
to ask that jenny be suspended from sudo room. 

(I have never threatened Eddan. I do not think Jenny
 has threatened Eddan. The only &quot;threat&quot; I can really
 imagine Jenny making is for Eddan to stay away
 from her. I was not at the bar, but
 the accounts that I have been given are very 
 different from his. I have been unwelcoming
 only so far as I have still greeted and had
 brief but neutral conversations with Eddan,
 like asking how he's been.)
&lt;/pre&gt;
== sudo-discuss email from Eddan ==
&lt;pre&gt;
how dare you!?!
please stop the personal attacks.
you make  a big fuss about moving and you veto any 
solution where we have to deal with the landlord. 
and then when we follow your leadership, you double back. 
what's the deal, marc?

(I am sure that i made myself very clear at the past
 meetings that i was not vetoing anything, and that
 i would go with the group decision.
 We did not make a group decision to terminate the lease.)
&lt;/pre&gt;
== sudo-discuss email from Eddan ==
&lt;pre&gt;
maybe you should also share with the group our discussion 
about how if anything happened at sudo room, i would be 
the one that would have to worry about liability. 
that seemed fine with you. what kind of person are you, marc?

(I have never opposed taking Eddan off the lease
 and I have supported suggestions to get liability insurance)
&lt;/pre&gt;
== sudo-discuss email from Eddan ==
&lt;pre&gt;
i totally agree that we should keep cool.
which is why i suggested, with enough lead time to 
make something real happen, that we re-visit the lease.

i was not concerned about liability until several 
specific comments made by Marc that made me worry 
about some plan he seemed to be hatching up.

(... i have no clue)

also, though i understand that it most likely comes 
from Marc's strange attachment to demonstrating he's 
in charge at Sudo Room, when it is supposed to be a 
collective cooperative, i do feel the need to explain 
myself given the gross mischaracterization Marc seems 
capable of. the reason i was not as present this past 
summer as i'd hoped to be was because i was taking the 
CA bar so we can actually deal with the pending legal 
issues Sudo Room.

(Eddan canceled sudo room's lease without waiting for
 a group decision, yet I am the one with a strange
 attachment to demonstrating that I am in charge.
 I know that the CCL email was somewhat harsh,
 but it was, in my opinion, the truth with the bullshit 
 cut out. I want everyone to realize how serious this
 really is: Eddan may have ruined our chances at having 

OK - below I'm going to also list the extent to which Marc demonstrated a complete lack of knowledge of the basic terms of what renting a place. Everything in this section is so bogus that Marc should be embarrased to have written it.
-Eddan
 shared space with CCL. I do not feel inclined to make
 allowances or excuses for his failings.)

Present: 
    marc, matt, eddan, miguel, max, jordan, danny,

    '''we  have concensed that if there are no objections accompanied by an  alternative set of article of assocition within a week that we will use  the articles of association marc has proposed to drive to sacramento and  get incorporated'''

==announcements==
*public schule general meeting tommorow 530
    
==articles of incorporation==
marc is proposing a modified form of noisebridges articles of incorporation.
finer points
===board of directors===
we can kick them out by majority vote
thinking of ways to have them be officious but without too much dictator powers
*Alternatives proposed
**Term limited stop gap board
**Charade board &quot;cardboard cut out&quot;, only do bare minimum. (liked by peeps)
**No fundraising
=====board action====
the four things that are necessary for a board action are:
*meeting
*notice
*quorum
*voting
===decision making===
board would decide by consensus n-1
a certain number of nonboard members would have to be at every board session for quourum with no executive session
===profit donations records funding===
this has to be non-profit, what activities are precluded for that? start-ups. maybe peeps are not ok with that.
===federal tax status===
we will do 501c* and decide the wildcard later
===articles of association by laws===
we need by laws and they could be based on articles of association
should include
*exclude board members from voting in recall
*require open meetings
*have some number of nonvoting member
*no exec session
===risk assessment===
there will power in a few people, can this be stemmed by cultural norms and ease to 
===insurance===
from the noisebridge copypasta
===articles 6.1===
who becomes members?
noisebridge says one person has to vouch you~
or application process
===articles 3===
this is noisbridge copypasta plus our values from articles of association</text>

    us vs the mormons

    Amateur is not opposite to professional -- it means love, damn it.

    Noisebridge is a device to tune attennas!

    Norman Bradley announces FCC accepting applications, he's been working with Noisebridge.

    John is doing outreach to other orgs to have more folks apply. 

    What is the chance?

    How much time to apply?

    No financial cost, takes about an hour once you have all the information prepared. 

    If you're granted a license, you have to buy certified equipment, ~$1,000 - $2,000

    more like $5000-$25000 says jake who has actually helped set up LPFM stations

    Cost also of finding a location for the antenna

    Are they waiving the second-adjacent channel requirement?

    To be decided. currently it is not waived, so there are ZERO stations in the bay area.

    Hope it will happen, can't know for sure.

    Deadline is November 14th. Soon. 

    Ferment Change event, happening at sudo. - Leslie

    All funds are benefiting Fat Beets Produce that has to move from their current location in the next few months. They have have a farm stand once a month.

They also work with farmers who are vendors, and run a CSA (community-supported agriculture box service).

    A month of different events. Workshops, co-founder of Fat Beets works on it, lots of stuff there. This weekend is Kimchi making for instance.

    BADcamp - Thurs - Sunday Oct 24 - 27, UC Berkeley. http://2013.badcamp.org/

    It's FREE

    Internet Archive event

    just a few days on the 38 geary

    electronic music event in our common space, saturday 10/26

2. Articles of Incorporation

    Eddan brought up co-op models and other forms of corporations, based on implicit hierarchy.

    You can't /really/ get rid of the hierarchy, Noisebridge basically just ignores it (as best as possible)

    Eddan also told me (Matt) that he doesn't want to propose an alternative at this time, not worth it at the moment .

    people who can give us advice: http://www.theselc.org/cafe/

    the meeting warmly did not-not-consent to incorporating with the articles

    volunteers to be on sudo's board:

    there should be a discussion about who is on the board, and consensus on a list

    what about nominations? that's the &quot;ask&quot; list. - created after i asked ;)

    Asked: Yar (no, sorry)

    Ask: Troy, Eddan, Marina, Morten, Liberty

    Offered: marc, hol, matt, jenny

3. Ensuring that events are aligned with sudo room values

    There was an event in the building that was sponsored by Northrop-Gruman (defense $ contractor), but it was also a local teacher working with students, so there was an opportunity to &quot;convert&quot; them. Two problems:

    1. info@sudoroom.org sucked. This resulted in a delay.

    2. Folks didn't see the event posted because of short-notice. 

    How do we work on these issues?

    N number of days to event? But this is difficult...

    What's an event, what's not? 

    Phone tree - A couple people add their name in case they're interested in vetting events. 

    Maybe a &quot;less than 48 hours, make a call&quot;

    Member vetting? Unofficial sudo events might be a good way to think about this. Official only in retrospect.

    Veto power of each member

    Vicky and Marc discussed potentially starting a system on the mailing list to mark [Tags] such as [!] (meaning, read this thing ASAP).

    Action Items:

    * Phone trees - notification of email only.

    Calls / Texts you?  - Tom :D

    * Contacts for awesome event collaboration, for feedback on last-minute events

    Timon, Marc, Tom, Matt, Jenny

    Proposal:

    Categories of events we strongly discourage

    events not open to the public (already a long established policy)

    events sponsored by or held by arms manufacturers or defense industry

    possible other categories if they arise - list acknowledged as incomplete

    There won't be extra infrastructure for vetting events but these values will be applied do-o-cratically by the community. To help with this, we strongly encourage tags to be used on the mailing list:

    [event] for events

    [!] for urgent or potentially controversial things

    What's required of a board member?

    http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/nonprofit-directors-personal-liability-32357.html

    London Hack Space uses http://www.oneclickorgs.com/ instead of board meetings.

    Use terminology &quot;Board of Trustees&quot; http://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Directors

    &quot;Although some trustees are also very active members of the community, it isn't the trustees' duty to handle day-to-day running of the space. This is handled by members themselves.&quot;

    Trustees are responsible for:

    Making sure that the organisation is operating in accordance with its goals.

    Ensuring that the organisation is financially healthy.

    Setting the constitution and rules of the space, in consultation with the members.

    Formally warning and banning members in accordance with the Grievance Procedure.

7. Additional Notes

    this site is the housing/food co-op that brendan was a member of the board at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_Association_for_Cooperative_Housing

    this is a great organization that seems to sesonate with the  structure of the shared space we spoke of. I think we could benefit by reaching out to organizations like this to get tips, or even just stories from more experienced folks. http://www.as220.org/</text>

1. Announcements

    Events for this week: https://sudoroom.org/calendar

    Review the events for this week--what's happening?

    Rackspace maybe wants to give us money?

    We were recommended for a grant ;)

    but requires W-9 forms, do we have that?

    for the w-9 we need the board of directors (true? - unknown)

    apparently there are still options

    grant is approx $4000

    not 100% we would get it, but quite likely

    Update on The Omni

    The omni a space

    everyone at a previous meeting agreed it was a good idea to pursue it further

    its more difficult to buy, business mortgages apparently need 30-50% of 1.9million. lease at $13,000 per month for two years

    Marc is getting more info from owner before he can propose a consensus item.

    leasing triple-net means you are more responsible than a regular tennant.

    updates to the wiki

    Vicky is a superhero with regards to the wiki

    categorizing the wiki into events/projects/stubs'

    &quot;the tortoise will win the race&quot;

    yar - &quot;our long term goal is to turn the wiki into the front page&quot; noisebridge-style

    vicky invites people to work with her - on vicky time. (STOP. It's Vicky time.)

    Board ratification is delayed in favor of antidramatic juice-a-thon

    regret to inform beloved room that faust will not be accepting nomination at this time, due to unfortunate conflict; she hopes that this opportunity presents itself again in the future.  she also expects to be there, albeit late, with cake.

    julio accepts nomination

    Y u no http://www.walmartstores.com/sites/annualreport/2008/_images/pic_board_of_directors.jpg ?

    everyone not privy to this drama is thinking &quot;thank goodness&quot;

    It should look more like this: http://www.shtig.net/consensus_spiral_4web_med.jpg

    New color laser printer :D

    consent to spend less than $200 for the printer for toner

    if someone wanted to donate.

    it's awesome!

    Are we incorporated? Can we start getting a real bank account and moving services off members' private credit cards?

    Matt investigated a couple of credit unions. Makes a recommendation:

    Do get an Internet Archive Federal Credit Union account (don't use it for too much)

    Must pay for frequent debit transactions

    Most services take charges.

    Do get a Patelco Federal Credit Union account (use for debit, bills)

    Skip

    People's Federal Credit Union

    Cooperative Federal Credit Union

    &quot;note that with credit unions you can often do transactions at a credit union not yours and have them post to yours, they are in cahoots as credit unions&quot; - faust

    we have 2 bitcoins, marc controls the wallet but will transfer it to us as soon as there is an &quot;us&quot;

    rhodey - if theres no penalty for just  go for it

    Update from Timon and Marc on alcohol permit situation

    Timon- Marc was right

    get smashed for $35 with an average of 3 days noticed.

    $35 with 3 days notice

    Thankstaking potluck?

    faust is in, ok faust, take it.

    seeking date/time/deets

2. Articles of Incorporation

    not approving board of directors (see above)

3. Finances

    all our new cash == standing funds. hands off, act normal.

    no exchequer? no bank balance info?

    current exchequer team does not currently have access to online bank account (can't wait to move to patelco!). check from soex on its way after completion of contract, w-9, signatures, which will be presented to the group at the next meeting.

4. conflict resolution

    Timon - constable/conflict steward. The conflict that neither of the two parties wanted to bring t o us. Elliot and Shake. Timon noted them, both of them declined to meet officially. 

    Shake is showing good faith by sharing some perspective.

    the private portion is proceeding.

    Shake speaks - he likes sudo room - he helped dj. at some point he was just working and elliot asked questions about an occupy oakland. he felt like he did explain to elliot, they even went outside. he felt like he wasn't welcome any more. then he found out he had a conflict on the agenda. &quot;keep in mind that i do not want anyone to be uncomfortable because of me&quot;. says that because he is a political figure that there will always be oppoonents. now feels uncomfortable because he doesn't understand that why elliot.  gives a message that he wants to be here and help

    Eventually, sudo came around to realize that our actions during the meeting are not the best execution and interpretation of our Conflict Resolution procedure of the Articles of Association, ending the conversation about the details of any specific conflicts. 

    tl;dr shake tried his best but we can't do anything because the other person never showed up

    If anyone has a conflict or wants to resolve things they may have heard or speculate with other members, reach out to the person in question, or find another sudoer to act as a mediator.

mate made $128
5. After- Meeting Teamups 

    bank teamupu

    juice meetup

6. Action Items

Action items from last meeting need to be completed.
==announcements==
* Calendar https://sudoroom.org/calendar
* info@sudoroom.org is a public-facing email!

    * If you want to receive these messages, join the list http://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/info

    * Remember that people messaging this do not assume it will be posted publicly. Archives not public to respect their privacy.

* Hamburg hosting Chaos Computer Congress (CCC) hacker convention, more social justice oriented, though there is still plenty of security stuff. Not sure if talks are posted yet. Equal parts hacking, socializing, three days, it's awesome.

    * https://tickets.events.ccc.de/

    * December 27th-30th, 2013 – Hamburg, Germany

    * Only $100, airline now $1300.

* Max is going to read a list of places and percentages. Guess what the statistics are!
* Facebook post to start a mackerspace in basement of The Buzzword Hub: Oakland. #h#a#s#h#t#a#g#i#t#s#a#r#e#a#l#t#h#i#n#g#

    * If you're interested in fielding the proposal, seeking something more like TechShop, less like Noisebridge?

* Sudo room maintains a positive disposition, excited for enabling a creative community and hackerspace to flourish.
==fiscal solvency==
*max comments since the treasurer of the board is the one person that takes on liability for sudo room, shouldn't that person be the exchequer with a finance committee to lighten bookkeeping.

    * Only liability is whether the accounting is done correctly. Otherwise it's the general liability of being a board member. This is similar to Noisebridge. That being said, I am not a lawyer (IANAL). 

    * Max: It's all good.

    * Matt needs to get bank accounts, Patelco and Internet Archive Federal Credit Union

    * https//iafcu.org/

       Nominated: Rhodey, Len, Vian, Shake, Mitch, Brendan, Faust

==discussion==
* Rackspace grant (not raytheon)

    * Got a random email on info@sudoroom.org. They wanted info that we have since we just incorporated anyway. Marc sent in all the info. Say something if you think rackspace is wack (doesn't seem likely) or some reason not to get no-strings-attached cash. 

* The Omni update

    Marc and Matt speak:

    48th and Shattuck

    21k sq ft

    $16k/mo 2-3 years

    Deposit $50k

    $1.95MM sale price

    collective of collectives, opportunity for community

    The opportunity on the table is to be able to engage in a lease that has a purchase option for this building. The landlord is seeking serious parties to create a genuine community space. Not anyone would 

    Max dissents:

    0.6mi from MacArthur BART which means

    exposing visitors to additional risk walking

    further from E and W oakland, which means we will be less able to offer our services to those areas, which in turn is disproportionately affecting lower socioeconomic classes, which is against our mission.

    not in downtown w/ 1st friday

    more expensive and we have low finances

    Matt speaks:

    Need to find bldg inspector and architect to check building

    Opportunity is in having a community of other groups all in building

    Find out more about guarantors, get specifics from landlord

    Add contingency in purchase for permitting, inspection, etc

    Vicky speaks:

    Look for welfare setup to avoid property tax

    If have enough nonprofit sub-entities, can be exempt from property taxes

    Hol Speaks:

    &quot;Doubles down&quot; on range from BART issue ie it is an issue.

    Matt speaks:

    Not too into range from BART metric, many issues here, hard to find a good spot but continue actively looking for best option.

    Vicky

    Discussing Rachel's thread about gentrifying effect.  Temescal vs here, mugging, we have computer$ on our bodies.  A business had customers robbed en route to BART. We would be perceived as gentrifiers in temescal.  Would never walk down telegraph at night. 

    Eddan on stack:

    supports what Matt was saying, that is, not to pass up an opportunity. we said we wanted to connect with other groups.  it would be valuable just to go through the research phases though.

    Vicky, 

    and third point. It would be a positive next step. wants to Take a step back from emphasizing the need to move. 

    Matt: 

    I want to value everyone's participation and input. 

    Max on stack:

    offer to post this discussion to board and also vindicate matt

    Matt:

    just make sure that this

    Vicky:

    Do you feel like we are good faith collaborating?

    Matt:

    Basically, yes.

    Marc:

    2 things going on. 1 is the omni. and yes its possibly its too expensive. but 2. we are increasing collaborating with other groups so that's good, it might not be the omni, but it is a good step to getting new place.

    REmote yar:

     also doeSnt like tHe locatiOn but likeS the susainability part Of it

     

* Sudouino https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Sudouino

    #THISSHITISREAL

    * Hol doesn't necessarily have to, but is asking to use the sudo name and such for this project.

    * Marc: is it open hardware? Hol: Yes. Marc: Will chinese people suffer? Hol: No only the most local people will suffer. 

    ...break for bad religion lyrics: And then you told me how bad you had to suffer, Is that really all you have to offer?...

    * Device has 7-pin holes, just like the sudoroom logo--it will fit perfectly! http://sudoroom.org/wiki/Logo

    * What's different about this from an arduino?

    * Power

    *

* Aorta (like the heart bit) Proposal

    * bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum, bum-bum

    vicky: i want that.

** Please reach out to other individuals and organizations to also contribute to anti-oppression, inclusivity, and accessibility.
* Timeless, Infinite Light, other printing collective, BAPS, sudo, corp watch, salta. Discussed how a collective of collectives would operate. Reaching out for more feedback from folks who haven't joined in the convo yet. Looking at sudo conflict resolution procedure for inspiration. Music collectives are a possibility. Concerns:
** Distance from BART (48th and shattuck, nearest MacArthur station) 15 min walk.
** There is Wheelchair-accessible bus to location.
** Crime
** Temescal is fairly upper-class, gentrifying, juxtaposed with crime.
** Uptown gentrifying rapidly
** Space is largely ADA compliant, lifts can be installed.
** Long-term thinking--if we were to procure this building, could sell in 5 years for instance. 
** Visioning session: folks wrote down their vision and collected (in notes).
*** Anti-capitalist used 4 times. Open space. Diverse range of creative collectives.

** https://sudoroom.org/wiki/8th_and_Alice
* Update on pursuit of new quarters
**On Monday Jenny and Matt checked out a space after being invited by Jeremy Liu. See wiki.
**CCL thinks that second floor is more interesting, because they think the roof top is unattractive and is available by stairs only. waiting on quote for the other part of second part about 1,400 sf. 
**BAPS tl;dr. Not married to the Omni, but are in love with moving in with more people. 
**Public School speaks (David): BAPS likes the idea that of many groups together. Good sympathy. BAPS wants a radical space, so they don't want it to be an incubator for Laney because that's not radical pedagogy. Not married to any one space. But BAPS reiterate that it would be the most radical to collect all these cells of community. Did calculation that if we could put down 750,000 on 2M building then we only needed $7k per month.
**We do have a contact in the city who has written some of the zoning laws we'll have to contend with
* TABLED - Solidarity and Unity. Let's refocus.  What's with all the division. Can we go back to the compact.
==conflict resolution==
* Nothing to do unless someone is pursuing an action against someone else and mediation has failed
==action items==
* marc -- to investigate printer recoup cost
===post-meeting teamups==
* Convo with Shake and tim
===Liberty Hall===
** How did we save this?
** Common space normally used for organizing.
** Pullman Porters, union organizing -- helped Malcolm X for instance.
** Continued to be an organizing space.
** Marcus Garvey bought it, used it as an outpost for 3 years
** Pentacostal church Father Divine, bought it.
** Father Ayende, doing a lot of good things with the building.
*** STory is that he hurt himself. Hopped over a fence chasing a guy who stole a womanatment.
** Overcomers with Hope took over the building, which became a media production studio for underprivilege youth.
*** This is how Shake heard about the building.
*** Shake was seen as Occupy, deep down everybody knew what occupy was about, banking system, foreclosure defence.
*** Thinks weren't exactly going well, but the organization of occupy was in tact. A little bit of power, and it was relevant.
***  AFter occupy imploded, Shake saw a petition from a friend Ayuri.  Realized Liberty Hall needed help. Shake met with the group, almost same  week one year ago. Shake had done almost 4 press conferences that year  working with the media, he knew how to get media attention for pretty  much whatever.
***  GAve some advice, don't do it in the middle of December. Made a press  release on 7th of DEcember. Got on DAvey D at 8am, press conference at  10am, city council at 10pm, which got all the media on it, got a letter  from Citibank. Through all the hoopla, Citibank actually responded.
*** Having walked in the room with Bishop Watkins, Citibank was not cooperative.
***  Got a letter from Citibank on December 21st, 2012, offering to sell for  $375,000 (on the last day of the univers&quot;0-. Shake thought it was a  joke. I.e. if it's the end of the world, then you have a chance to save  this building.
***  This letter was used as a starting point, which is when Tim came in.  Outreach promotion media tasks rolling. Did extensive fund-raising after  that.
** Tim came in at this point for the forensics of the negotiation.
*** Tim had heard from Shake about the building during Occupy. 
*** Primo, rapidly gentrifying area.
*** Tim came down and took a look, 
***  In his day job, Tim is a foreclosure defense lawyer. Trying to  negotiate with banks. Has lots of experience. They are more likely to  negotiate now. Before it was like water from a rock. They'd treat  you---you'd come to them saying &quot;I've got good credit&quot; but the problem  they have is when you approach a major bank like Citibank, etc you can't  make a deal. Some more complicated bureaucracy keeps that from working  out.
*** Tim suspects gentrification strategy. Closest bart stop to the city, WEst Oakland is becoming EAst San Francisco. 
*** let's be candid, that area can be pretty hot from time to time.
*** Banks aren't going to bother making deals, just push people out, loan developers money.
***  Tim's job was to eliminate all the possibilities, where there is no  reason to say no. They need to line up everything they asked for.
*** This is where community leverage could step in if Citibank didn't want to play ball.
**  Shake's role was to be able to step in to share community power and  stories, got the momentum to ensure that this is an issue that the bank  can't get out of.
***  Hard to get coverage, but ended up getting SF Bayview. Internet is a  young thing for folks under 30. The people who have the most money read  paper still and go to church. Bayview printed the press release, and the  wife of an investor talked to her husband about it, got riled up about  doing something.
*** Investor liked what Shake had to say. Exchange showing good experience overall at REvolution CAfe
*** Need to be careful that the word getting out was actually accurate based on what was happening.
*** Once the wheels were turning, Shake assumed they couldn't find another investor.
*** Since the investor was really connected, they brought in the Black Nurses ASsociation. Also, Healthy Oakland.
***  With Tim's help, this was highly important, it was possible to deal  with the city. The Mayor and the city tried to bring in lawyers to  squash on the deal. They provided help ultimately, to make it an  inclusive deal.
*** Used the investor's A1 credit to create a 3-tier partnership between Black Nurses ASsociation, Healthy Oakland, and ?
*** Tim had to step in especially when the investor came on board.
*** Tim delivered an offer letter in-person, saying they're an investor with cash, we want to buy the building.
**** Got nothing for a couple of weeks.
**** Emailed one to foreclosure management company that was actually pushing the process.
****  Whenever you're dealing with a large corporate bank, they'll work with  lots of sub-contractors to deal with individual properties, etc.
**** Tim reached out to colleagues to make sure to get the right phone numbers for folks.
**** Talked to the real estate agent, 
*** WEre prepared to do direct action. 
*** Walked into the deal with a black respected community member investor, to instigate whether not making the 
*** Do you have the authority to make a deal with me?
**** But response was &quot;I just got this case, I can't make a deal&quot;
**** AFter a bunch of phone calls, were able to get to someone to make a deal.
*** Primary investor (doesn't want to be known in public) used his contacts to get to an alternative bank.
****  Over time, there was some money from Healthy Oakland, $100,000 and  another $120,000 from his own pocket, plus a hard money loan, and with  that they were able to gather the $375,000 necessary to save the  building. It's a definite win for gentrification and a national historic  landmark, but there's still /a lot/ of work to be done by the partner  organizations.
***  Tim chimes in, primary investor has a real estate broker. Tim's clients  don't usually have real estate agents, he doesn' thave those kinds of  connections.
*** However, the real estate agent was able to find someone with whom they could actually make a deal.
*** All the legal things necessary to make the proper hand-off was performed by this real estate agent.
***.
***  Shake worked on making sure folks in the community knew this was an  issue and could keep pressure up and on the potential for this to be an  issue.
*** You must have a direct action strategy, a very important part of the strategy.
*** Tim provided the &quot;cynnicism check&quot; to remember that these people &quot;are out to hustle us&quot; 
*** The reaosn the banks always outsource everything to put a buffer between them and clients.
****  For instance, the cashier's check laws in CAlifornia can be exploited  to hustle you since it can take long if &quot;it's lost&quot; and you need the  bank to re-issue.
**** The bank can blame the outsourcing company for instance.
** Shake wants to end with a lesson from occupy
*** Sometimes folks think you need lots of committees, and sub-commiittees ,and by-laws. But you really need two thinks
**** Resources (space, etc)
**** Outreach (mouthpiece)
*** There can be an economy of moving the media without necessarily having to work too hard (coordinate a lot of people)
** Shake refuses to believe you could foreclose on a black historical landmark during Black History Month. 
***  Without outreach, media, and resources, you can't have a movement. You  can win buildings, you can change charters, you can change things. They  seek to destroy. The first thing they're going to look for is: who's  being the loudest, how are they getting their voice out there, and how  are they paying for it.
*** Everything is flow-charted in call center scripts.
**** You have to break the script, or escalate. There is always someone who has the power to say &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;
**  For sudo--kick ass. You're in a better position. Make sure it's what  you want, and make sure you use that building for the community.
*** It's not just about winning, it's not about an end, it's about setting up for the next win.
***  August 7th, when we closed on the building, the spirits of marcus  garvey, malcolm x, the spirits of whoever were applauding and that's all  I needed from that. I've done a lot but this is one of the biggest  things I've accomplished because I didn't know how to do it. I just new I  wasn't going to let them foreclose on a black historical landmark  during black history month.
** If we can help, let us know, I'm down with sudo.
* Currently, the three groups are determining how to use the space. 
** Healthy Oakland is going to use it for health screening
** Black Nurses will do normal work, bloodpressure drives, etc. 
** Overcomers with Hope are going to retain the studio for the community.
* These groups didn't know each other prior to this, so this is a new collaboration for them.
* How does this connect to larger struggles?
**  Tim - thinks about this all the time. How do you really drive a  revolutionary process? You need mass popular support. You need people on  the other side of the table to believe that if they don't do this,  there are going to be very grave consequences. The threat on the table  of the community (esp. for pr) from this building forces these folks to  take you seriously. You need to know every single angle they can  possibly take--the full spectrum of resources that can be deployed  against you. THere is lots of theory around that. Shake comes in with  social media strategy. Though now we know there are these Palantir folks  that will fuck with your social media program. You have to be aware  that there will be folks messing with your program, though it will still  be beneficial to drive your campaign. Where is your funding coming  from?? Old folks, rich folks, bitcoin, crowd-funding? You have to admit  that your mutual aid networks will eventually interact with the market,  so you need some connections there, as well as with a buffer to protect  your network from capitalism. When you had $10,000s in the bank, you  could do more stuff. Paid for food, paid for bailout. Standard policy of  $100 to any group of 3 or more with an idea. Tim would talk to finance  people in NY who had a really professional finance operation that  delivered, safe-guarded cash, and bail people out of jail. The suspect  was that Portland, LA, Houston, etc also had a way of interacting with  the capitalist economy.
*  Shake adds, with the base of finances, you also protect your primary  activists. Shake contends that there is no such as a movement of a  leader or leaders. Doesn't mean that these folks need to be public. You  have to protect those people, it's never one, by having some kind of  base so they don't burn themselves out. That's what I mean by outreach,  by publicity, media, and resources. If the outreach is moving faster  than the resources, then you look back and you're starving and no place  to stay. In activism you have to have some line that's attached to the  system, if you don't have any economic base, you're setting your people  up for failure. You have to have both and be active. Shake was blessed  to communicate to the media and have them respect him enough to at least  pay attention to the press releases. Prior to that, banks would not  even talk to the activists around Liberty Hall. Grandmas with bullhorns  in front of citibank was the real fear that pushed the bank to move.  There is no court system, there's a court of public opinion. The only  place you're going to fight these people is the public opinion, because  they're scared of you and of mass movements. That's the only thing that  will stop them from there little greedy-love fests.</text>

'''THE TRADITIONAL MONOTONIC READING OF THE CALENDAR'''
* Calendar https://sudoroom.org/calendar
** Omni Meeting Thurs at 7pm at The Public School, at 2141 Broadway.
** &quot;Battle for Oscar Grant Plaza&quot; documentary screening Sunday, 3-5pm at Sudo Room: https://sudoroom.org/ai1ec_event/the-battle-for-oscar-grant-plaza-screening-and-discussion-on-police-accountability/?instance_id=75333
** Cryptoparty every Third Sunday. Join in the planning fun here: http://lists.sudoroom.org/listinfo/cryptoparty
* We need help forming a NEW hackerspace in Hayward!  We're planning to make a family-friendly space for both kids and adults.  Visit our website www.hayhackers.org for details.  Email bayareahayhackers@gmail.com if you'd like to help!
**want to make a video which is 1 minute from each bay area hackerspace

==fiscal solvency==
*$1258.25 in bank
*$276.76 from WePay (deposited) + $48.20 from WePay (will be deposited tomorrow)
*$30 cash
*Total: $1613.21
*Can we please raise $100 *right now*? There was some talk of doing another fundraiser for this First Friday, but I think we can do it without throwing a big party. The solution is not fundraising, but solidifying our membership process (see notes below).
==ammendments to articles of association==
*discussions soliciting input
*defining membership
**max: &quot;subsudo&quot; or suggested &quot;subprocess&quot;
***The idea is that each member is required to be part of one or more &quot;subsudo&quot;s. A subsudo is kind of like a committee or commission. You declare an interest and responsibility in a preexisting subsudo or create your own. Its totally fine if you just want to make the Churro subsudo and be responsible for that, but the point is that everyone is responsible for some part of sudo that we can always ask them about, and show there's an expectation of committment.
**max: raise minimum membership dues from $0 to $10
***Help raise funds since we have not been meeting finance expecations.
*** Exceptions made on case-by-case basis?
*** If can't pay, what else to offer?
**jenny: other factors to potentially include in our membership process:
***While the space remains open to all, 'membership' solidifies one's commitment to the sudo room community, and minimum dues *can* be negotiated for, say, those who live without money and prefer to barter their time/skills.
***24/7 access is a perk of membership, and involves receiving a personalized keycode.
***Limited offers of cubbies (an additional $10-20/month) and lockers ($30/month?) - we have about 22 cubbies and 8 (unused) lockers, so this could bring in close to $1k/month.
****Implementing this means we need to work on organizing the space better: https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Room_Usability_Notepad
***Agreement to our core values / Articles of Association
****Could include 'Respect of space and cleanliness therein' - should perhaps propose this an an Amendment..?
***Being vouched for by 1 or 2 current members - supportive skepticism
***&quot;Mutual Membership&quot; extends membership to Noisebridge, LOL, possibly other spaces (would propose this to NB for consensus in coming weeks, wrt LOL I think it would be a more informal agreement that we can formalize as membership 'perks' for both communities). - Perhaps more of a &quot;sister space&quot; model that doesn't imply membership per se, but alliance/solidarity - Use Hacker Passports as entry tokens
**sam says one of the things he's heard is that a membership requirement is to make a workshop where you teach your knowledge
==other items==
* Cleanup procedures
** There is now an 'Outbox' next to the 3D printer, to be emptied every Sunday PM
** fire safety inside sudoroom, landlord INSISTS
* From TABLED - Solidarity and Unity. Let's refocus.  What's with all the division. Can we go back to the compact.
* Move wednesday meeting time to 6:30, 7 sharp
==conflict resolution==

    Nothing to do unless someone is pursuing an action against someone else and mediation has failed

==announcements==
'''THE TRADITIONAL MONOTONIC READING OF THE CALENDAR'''
* Calendar https://sudoroom.org/calendar
** Cryptoparty this Sunday, 12/15 from 2-5pm

** Timon has been banned from the building by George (our landlord). It's not our responsibility to keep him out of the building, however, we have made it clear that he's not welcome in the sudo room proper.
** Discussion of issues re: landlord jurisdiction over sudo room policy
*Max: Can somebody take charge of organizing the anti-oppression training with Aorta Collective, I can forward correspondence?
** Matt is following up with Jiwon to schedule a date for the Theater of the Oppressed workshop. Sudoers will be invited, those who are interested may be requested to reach out to invite others who would benefit from the event. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theatre_of_the_OppressedT \max *snaps*
sudoroom got rearranged, it is epic, y'all rule

==fiscal solvency== 
* ~$250 in bank

**$400 in December (as of 12/11)
**$250 in November
**$915 in October

* pressure every single member present at meeting to sign up. that means YOU!
*Max: pressure every member that is not at the meeting to sign up. do we have phone numbers? &lt;-- start with those who you do
https://www.gittip.com/

==ammendments to articles of association==
*Max: subsudo proposal made. https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Subsudos
** Juul suggests it be 'encouraged' instead of 'required'
** Matt suggests the motivation is for every sudoer to feel responsibility toward some aspect of sudo, that one person could constitute a 'subsudo' and such a subsudo may be patently absurd [that this is a farcical amendment)
** yar isn't sure what problem it solves, thinks it's a great project but doesn't belong in the articles
** Jenny suggests it be a feature rather than a req.
** Ask Max for a concise explanation of the concise purpose of this amendment [Action Item for Max]
** Would it be more welcoming to let people know what theycan can do in order to plug in, or to empower them to create their own subsudos?
** segues into a lot of discussion on the philosophies of hackerspace fundraising, membership, &quot;we should build a box&quot;, etc -- as interpreted by yar who thinks it is bikeshedding at this point
** marc thinks the box should be black

==other items==
* Printing prices - https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Printing 
** Recommending a BYOP policy - paper can be purchased at Kelly Paper on 27th: http://kellypaper.com/store/oakland

* Move wednesday meeting time to 6:30, 7 sharp?
** matt wins it: potluck at 6:30, meeting at 7#
* Hol: Add sudo shifts and formalize minimum economic level of engagement to be considered a member.  I can help schedule shifts.
 +1 on shifts, but also never turn away money from people who are paying money. right now money is more scarce than person-hours, IMO.
 the energy should probably be put towards reaching out to potentially interested people -yar
* $10/min/month membership proposal
** Daniel: That will encourage people to only give 10
** Yar blocks initially, then relinquishes
** Let's give it time, see if it has an effect on our finances
* New space discussion - https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Potential_spaces
** Lots of options, but regardless we need to renegotiate our lease for January - will continue to remain here month-to-month (now signed as sudo). If we want to do something different, we need to decide that this month. 
** Whole floor, including corner office and office across from Public School, now available for $6500/month.
** George would also be happy if we rented just one more office in the common space ($900/month) - we might pursue groups who are in need of some space [eg; Mesh, Ners for Nature

==conflict resolution==
Nothing to do unless someone is pursuing an action against someone else and mediation has failed

==action items==
* look at room
*Investigate integrating Stripe and/or Balanced Payments [Jenny, Bill]
*Concise explanation of the purpose of this amendment [Action Item for Max]
*Ink donation jar
*Look into other hackerspaces' accounting system [Jenny]
*take on roommates

==ammendments to articles of association==
not at meeting but here it is (hol)
    
&quot;Sub-Section 3.4.3 Dues
Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation of $60 per month calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system. If the operating budget has a net surplus for three consecutive months, the minimum rate may be lowered to $0 by the general membership, to remain in effect as long as the budget is in surplus
See the proposal (needs to be updated) here: https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association/Minimum_Dues#Sub-Section_3.4.3_Dues and https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association#Sub-Section_3.4.3_Dues
Including but not limited to:
    Some negotiation of BACE time bank hours
    
completely gutted the old one that had calculations in it and shit.  the whole section needs to be rewritten really - hol
==Feedback:==
    Marc: Nov $$ unnecessary. Last line also unnecessary (as amendments can always be changed)
    Luciano: Include BACE Timebank hours, cryptocurrencies etc;
    Familiar: Encourage alternative currencies, active participation and instruction, grant application, food/barter...
* Defining membership.
** juul proposes 
*** That membership requires a minimum fee of $10 per month.
*** That membership does not automatically include the ability to vote.
*** That after 1 month of membership a member can show up to a meeting and  the community decides by consensus whether the person should become a  voting member.
*** That membership includes 24/7 access to the space with a personal access code and/or rfid.
*** That members don't ever have to show up in person if they don't want voting rights.
***  That we implement Jake's suggestion for handling non-members.  Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members  are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and  have to leave when the last member leaves. To empower members to deal  with problematic non-members, non-members can be thrown out at any time  by a member if that members feel they are being a problem, _unless_ some  other member present in the space is willing to vouch for the member as  a guest.
==Consensus items:==
** Membership includes 24/7 access to the space with a personal access method, for example code and/or rfid.
***Unanimous consent
** Non-members  can use the space as much as they want when other members are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and have to leave when the last member leaves.
***Discussion, mostly vibe-y 
** To empower members to deal with problematic non-members, non-members can be thrown out at any time by a member if that members feels that the non-member is being a problem, _unless_  some other member present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member as a guest. Non-members being asked to leave must be told that they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list. 
***Discussion: Some way of logging the incident? 
***Working Group: To reframe the above amendment
**Subsudo
Each sudo member is required to be part of one or more committees, team, other loose collection of sudoer(s) called a subsudo or subprocess.  Being part of a subsudo is not intended to tie a sudoer to a massive  commitment, but rather to illustrate some minimum responsibility your  want to claim at sudo room. You are expected to organize and maintain  your subsudo with your fellow subsudoers at some nonzero level. If no  preexisting subsudo appeals to a sudoer, then that sudoer may take  arbitrary time to create and list their own subsudo with no disqualifications allowed on the basis of absurdity. 
***Feedback: Humor value; way of showing new members what kind of activities/projects occur in the community; 
==Membership Discussion==
*Tim: Would be helpful if there was a clear benefit
*Matt: Refers to https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association/Assets_and_Resources and says the primary benefit is responsibility
*V: Individual recognition in the weekly meetings / wiki / generally
*Tim: Reframing: &quot;After one month of membership, new members are eligible to vote&quot;
*Familiar: Why wait 1 month for voting?  Do we not want members for &lt;4 weeks to have a say?
**Method for factoring trust into the membership process (which in this model is open), by making the most powerful aspect of membership something that is agreed upon by the group (indiv. right to vote in our consensus model).
*Marc: Emphasizes that the last component of the proposal - for kicking out problematic non-members - is to only be exercised when a non-member is being particularly problematic in the space
==discussions==
*tribalize? everybody wear the same thing?
* remote-yar proposes official camera policy:
** people taking pictures &amp; video should:
*** acquire consent from everyone
*** acquire consent and review again before publishing
*** applies to all identifying data: face, voice, body, name, etc
*** strict RFC-2119 compliance of &quot;should&quot; vs &quot;must&quot; to be debated
* Get new lease for 2141 Broadway (update to sign with &quot;sudo room&quot; as an entity)

**&quot;There are very few profitable documentaries.&quot;
** #1 more divisive than #2
** Clarification on the wiki, consensus vote postponed to next week

* [Consensus] Hol's proposal on a minimum monthly dues of $10 approved w/ amendments in Dec: 
***That membership requires a minimum fee of $10 per month. (See https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association/Minimum_Dues Hol's proposal up for consensus) 
**&quot;Don't be afraid to ask for a higher number - or in-kind donations&quot;
**&quot;Tracking time is way too much overhead.&quot;
**Brendan proposes ToDo list / issue tracker
**From a new person: &quot;Freemium model; two beers; seems reasonable&quot;
**Straw poll: Mostly supportive, 2 abstaining

* Consensus on 3/4 Items from juul's 'Membership' proposal: https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Articles_of_Association/Membership
1. [Consensus] That membership includes 24/7 access to the space with a personal access code and/or rfid.

[Postponed] To empower members to deal with problematic non-members, non-members can be thrown out at any time by a member if that members feel they are  being a problem, _unless_ some other member present in the space is willing to vouch for the member as a guest. Non-members being asked to  leave must be told that they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list.  
**We need to have a policy on this, but should be written in a more nonviolent manner.

4. [Postponed] Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and  have to leave when the last member leaves.

 MORE PRACTICAL REWORDING OF THIS: https://sudoroom.org/wiki/Filming_at_sudo_room
 That members don't ever have to show up in person if they don't want voting rights. 
 NONVIOLENT REWORDING OF: To empower members to deal with  problematic  non-members, non-members can be thrown out at any time by a  member if  that members feel they are  being a problem, _unless_ some  other member  present in the space is willing to vouch for the member as  a guest.

To empower members to deal with problematic non-members, non-members can be removed by a member who feels their behavior is problematic, *unless* another member present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member as a guest. Non-members being asked to leave must be told that they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list. 
Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and have to leave when the last member leaves.
   * Suggestion that we auto-ban anyone who has been banned by noisebridge unless at least one member objects. New bans to be adopted at each weekly meeting. - juul
   * Matt suggests a rule that our bureacracy can't be used against us.

==Conflict Resolution==

==Misc==

* Problems with people sleeping here and otherwise being problematic.
** In a week we will have a 2/3rds vote to Ban Sarah and Ardeen from the space.

* Some folks want to have a radical mycology microscopy event at sudo room in February
** They will bring teachers, materials and tools (microscopes)
** They will have a maximum of 15 people participating
** They want to charge $35 per person and give 10% of that to sudo room
** The money is going to bay area radical mycology collective, teachers, eventbrite, flyer artist and sudo
** We need to decide if we allow for-pay events (where the teachers are paid)
*** juul likes the following principles:
      GAYABAGS: Give as you're able but always give something. 
      NOTAFLOF: No-one turned away for lack of funds.
      
      Goes against our common space rules: &quot;must be free or donation-based&quot;
    Request a new proposal more in line with our values
 Cost seems rather prohibitive given values around educating and mobilizing the community
 Request they make it a $35 suggested donation, with no need to give a percentage to sudo room

==Consensus Items==

=== Proposal to ban ardeen ===
* https://lists.sudoroom.org/pipermail/sudo-discuss/2014-February/005374.html
* yar thinks ban sounds harsh - maybe temporary? 2 months?
* &quot;To empower members to deal with problematic non-members, non-members  can be removed by a member who feels their behavior is problematic,  *unless* another member present in the space is willing to vouch for the  non-member as a guest. Non-members being asked to leave must be told  that they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on  the mailing list.  Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members  are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and  have to leave when the last member leaves.&quot;
* Ardeen is present and pleading forgiveness, but Marc still doesn't trust him
* Matt hadn't received an apology until now and is not happy. He finds &quot;the whole narrative disrespectful&quot;. He'd rather things be about the community respecting each other and not about conflicts and bans. (?)
* Ardeen feels he tried to reach out and was treated with anger and vendetta
* yar hears &quot;it's not about sleeping or breaking rules, it's about respect&quot; but thinks the email seemed about exactly that
* conversation gets heated, yar imposes stack with 30 second time limit each
* voting
** 6 votes for a permanent ban of ardeen
** 1 against - ardeen himself
** 5 abstaining
** this is less than 2/3. motion fails.
* vote on a temporary one-month banning of ardeen
** 12 for
** 0 against
** 2 abstains
** motion passes. Matt notes that the Public School has voted to uphold our bans.

=== proposal to ban sarah ===
* &quot;She isn't here. Word she's left the city.&quot;
* &quot;she's been sleeping here after being warned, and also knowingly ate my food.&quot;
* &quot;she's had conflicts at Noisebridge and refused arbitration there, which is not a good sign&quot;
* &quot;I'd support this ban more if it were about violence or extreme disrespect&quot;
* &quot;We need a committee on social affairs&quot;
* voting
** 5 in favor
** 0 against
** 6 abstentions
** motion seems to fail?
** Feedback from abstainers:
*** Having a calm person unattached to the conflict to serve as ally for
*** Permanent bans pretty harsh - people can change
*** Homelessness is a transient condition
*** process is broken since abstentions and no-votes seemed to be equivalent here
*** Eliot suggests permanent bans be reserved for violent oppression, but supports long-term bans
** &quot;I will reach out to her and say she's not banned but she's not welcome and should come to a meeting&quot;
** JC offers mediation in future conflicts

=== &quot;sudo room resolves to allow the Internet Archive Federal Credit Union to make deposits.&quot; ===
* There are no objections. We all feel pretty good to be voting on this.

=== noisebridge auto-bans ===
Suggestion that we auto-ban anyone who has been banned by noisebridge unless at least one member objects. New bans to be adopted at each weekly meeting. - juul
* See https://noisebridge.net/86 for current Noisebridge bans
* Matt suggests inserting a human approval method rather than auto-ban, citing Value # 5 of sudo room's Articles of Association:
** &quot;Value human judgment over automation and efficiency.&quot;
* &quot;Would this rule have solved problems in the past&quot; &quot;Yes&quot; &quot;yes&quot; &quot;yes&quot; &quot;YES!&quot;
* &quot;is the burden on individuals to monitor the noisebridge banlist in order to object in time?&quot;
* &quot;it literally just made the process easier with ardeen that public school had a similar vote on our banlist&quot;
** &quot;I didn't actually feel good mentioning BAPS' policy so I don't think that's a point in favor&quot;
* Brendan: &quot;In considering banning individuals from sudo room, it is valid to take into consideration any bans from other communities.&quot;
* &quot;I'd prioritize specific kinds of bans such as those involving sexual predators&quot;
** DOES THIS WORK?? &quot;Noisebridge bans can be given a temporary ban at sudo room by request of any member, to last until there is quorum to review the ban. Sudo room will consider all Noisebridge bans as potential bans at sudo room, going through the normal process&quot;
* &quot;There should be an opportunity to lift bans&quot;

=== bureaucracy rule ===
Matt suggests a rule that our bureacracy can't be used against us:
* &quot;Value fairness and common sense over prolonged process and bureaucracy.&quot;
* &quot;I finds this unimplementable and a little ironic&quot;
* &quot;if you want that to change, develop a mentality for it, don't wait for bureaucracy to solve it&quot;
* &quot;can we move this onto next week's agenda?&quot; [laughter]
** &quot;I propose this be highly prioritized to next week&quot;
* &quot;does anybody have a reason this should not be consensed to be in our articles?&quot;
** &quot;I do. It's an awesome value, but just words.&quot;
*** That's sort of the point ^.^ it's a poem!
* No consensus yet, more workshopping.

=== IRC ===

At the November 6, 2013 meeting, there was consensus that Marc Juul should be the sole founder of our IRC channel, freenode.#sudoroom - this was discussed on the mailing list, there have been no blocks or alternatives proposed. This meeting, with 16 people present, affirms that it has been solidly consensed on at this point. Sudoroom as an organization will now reach out to Freenode to make it happen.
* Asked for objections four or five times. No objections. phew!
* '''LATE EDIT:''' Links to [[Meeting_Notes_2013-11-06#extra_bizness|that meeting]] and the [https://lists.sudoroom.org/pipermail/sudo-discuss/2013-November/thread.html#4406 the mailing list thread] about it

=== consensus rule change === 
Juul suggests that we change the articles such that bans require 2/3 of the votes of present members, excluding abstainess.
* &quot;you should just use a normal voting process and not that weird process you just used&quot;
* &quot;can't consent on this now because the problem is deeper than this&quot;
* &quot;do i have to be a dues-paying member to vote?&quot;

==Conflict Resolution==
* &quot;kudos to facilitators&quot;

==Misc==
* Learning Collective w/ Haley (samarasteele@gmail.com)
** villagecraft.org
** wants to have events here

==After meeting teamups==
* Cyberpunk LARPing and software Microcontroller development.

* &quot;Section 2.1 Qualifications for Membership
** Membership is defined by fulfilling the following requirements:
*** Contributing monthly dues (sliding-scale with respect to operating costs) or equivalent.
**** It is an express purpose of the group to keep membership rates low, and therefore accessible, as well as offer, when possible, alternatives to monetary contribution to suffice for monthly dues.
*** A status of good standing with the organization.
**** Unresolved debts and/or substantial lapses in respecting the values of the organization and its members may result in suspension of membership, to be determined by fair process respecting individual rights and freedoms and the integrity of community norms.&quot;
* &quot;Dues shall be paid by members on a sliding scale basis, from the minimum $10 per month rate to the recommended donation calculated using the process below. Exemptions of individuals from paying dues may be approved on a case by case basis by the general membership on the grounds of financial hardship or refusal to participate in the monetary system&quot;
* Jenny set up membership system and it needs hacking

== Moving? ==
* matt says may 1 is the earliest realistic move-out date if we start now
* 8th and Alice https://sudoroom.org/wiki/8th_and_Alice
* apply to Community Loan Fund
* we will commit to notifying each other about space viewing opportunities
* what's the biggest hurdle? money? time?
* Omni vision
** Last week, this vision was officially bootstrapped into a collective of collectives, now seeking vision statements from the various groups re: purpose &amp; values
** Yar proposes: The &quot;Building Bloc&quot; is a new group committing to serve our wider communities by solving the legal, logstical, and economic problems related to holding physical spaces for the greater good. We are a meta-collective of a &quot;collective of collectives&quot;
*** Social, economic &amp; environmental justice, 
** new wiki page for proposals for vision for larger sudoroom
** Omni timeline is NOT quick. Sep 2014 move-in at the earliest. we should not wait for it. we should move now.
** incremental strategy
** moving together is a wonderful community-building experience. Let's U-haul it, you guys!

==Money==
* $346.16 on gittip - SO CLOSE to fully funding our operations!
* We have $9471.37(?) in the bank account 
* yar thinks our next fundraising drive should be gittip-centric

==Consensus Items==
* &quot;Value fairness and common sense over prolonged process and bureaucracy, i.e. our bureacracy can't be used against us&quot;
** Another value to add: &quot;Value heterarchy over hierarchy&quot;
** http://p2pfoundation.net/Heterarchy
* It takes a trial period of two weeks for new members to become full members. They can still get 24/7 access during this period but cannot vote.
** &quot;lurker mode&quot;
** we'll vote on this next meeting
** Marc will write the complete text and then send an email
* New members must be announced (or a list of current members must be available to members)
** &quot;new members are de-facto announced on the meeting notes&quot;
** this will work better when the SeltzerCRM works
** the point of this is that members have the right to know who all other members are (by name or p?se?udonym)
** &quot;Members have access to a list of all members&quot;
* If any three current members oppose a new person becoming a member during their trial period, then they cannot become a member.
** less strict than noisebridge, where any 1 person can block
** might prevent problems
** &quot;consensus minus three&quot;
* Xavier has proposals for dealing with future conflicts
* &quot;To empower members to deal with problematic non-members, non-members can be removed by a member who feels their behavior is problematic, UNLESS another member present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member as a guest. Non-members being asked to leave must be told that they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list.  Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members  are present, but cannot access the space when no members are there and have to leave when the last member leaves.&quot;
** + &quot;problematic, with regard to sudo room's values and these Articles of Association&quot;
** - &quot;Non-members can use the space as much as they want when other members  are present&quot;
** + &quot;Non-members cannot access the space when no members are there and have to leave when the last member leaves.&quot;
** in fact, sudoers should be ENCOURAGED to value their safety and that of others over letting people stay here who have violated sudo/ers
** In sum:
*** &quot;Any member may (must?) remove a non-member from the space if the member feels the non-member's behavior is problematic with regard to sudo room's values and these Articles of Association, UNLESS another member present in the space is willing to vouch for the non-member as a guest and therefore meaningfully engage in the conflict resolution process. Non-members asked to leave must be told they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list.&quot;
**** &quot;When a member feels a non-member's behavior is problematic with regard to sudo room's values and these Articles of Association, then either (a) the member may remove the non-member from the space or (b) another member may vouch for the non-member as a guest, and therefore meaningfully engage in a conflict resolution process. A removed non-member must be told they can further discuss the incident at a Wednesday meeting or on the mailing list.&quot;
***** &quot;When a non-member feels a member's behavior is problematic...&quot;
** yar proposes a &quot;throwing people out&quot; workshop/party where we role-play and make ourselves comfortable with doing it. will organize it next meeting.
** phil: &quot;non-members cannot access&quot; ... is that separate?
* &quot;Non-members cannot access the space when no members are present and non-members must leave when the last member leaves.&quot;
